	<h3>1-1 A New Anthropological Image</h3>
		
<div>To play a videogame, a person concentrates their attention on a panel of flashing lights while holding a controller or while resting their hands on a table, over a mouse and keyboard. There needs to have been at least one developer, which is the person who has anticipated this, the player’s posture. Between the player and developer, we can isolate two more elements: hardware and additional software. Concerning hardware, we might describe what its design and commodification contribute to the videogame event. With additional software – e.g. the operating system, game engine, drivers, etc. – the event becomes more cumbersome to represent and analyse. This is because each software instance, once considered, creates a new developer vis-à-vis player situation. A multitude of people – development teams with directors, designers, artists, programmers, etc. – are usually involved and manifest in the image. They have anticipated and responded to this labour performed by the player or user. In this way, each choreographed and automated computer process that is necessary for the gaming event to occur forms an overwhelmingly complex and genealogical matrix. A complete description of this mere experience – picks up the controller, ‘I'm going to play some <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> <span class="reference">(Gavin et al. <a href="r.html#Gavin 1996" target="_blank" title="Gavin A, Rubin J, Siller D, Zembillas C and Pearson J (creators) (1996) Crash Bandicoot [videogame]">1996</a>)</span>’ – entails a detailed history of computing, untangling the authorship of layers of code from binary to a ‘custom LISP dialect’ <span class="reference">(Gavin <a href="r.html#Gavin 2011" target="_blank" title="Gavin A (25 October 2011) ‘Lispings ala John McCarthy’">2011</a>:para.3)</span>, directed entirely at the conveyance of a singular image, with all its particularities – that time I defeated Dr. Neo Cortex.</div>
<br>
<div>This project will only fulfil a part of what I have just described, but there are other ways to regard the human event that is a videogame. I will demonstrate some of these presently. I call these specific descriptions or representations of the human being <em>images</em> in the same way I have described this entire document to be an image.</div>
<br>	
<div>Our first type of human image is the most obvious and the first one we experience, often before playing a game – to behold it is like being yelled at. I have embedded examples of these images throughout the document. Their emergence is ubiquitous across videogames as a medium; they are what videogames look like. They are pixelated, rasterized or ray-traced images of human (humanoid) characters killing, dying, solving problems, jumping, suffering, eating food, having sex, defecating, etc. (this list is in order of prevalence, from <em>ad nauseum</em> to strange novelty).</div>

<br>
<div>We can distinguish another type of human image from the one in <a href="#p2" title="Play 2: Images of humans in videogames" target="_blank">Play 2</a>, which is less obvious. This second image can demand a great deal from those who participate in its emergence, that is, from those who participate in the event which generates it. It is not immediately given and the spectacle of the first image, as we just saw, creates resistance for the second’s actualisation. The second image takes work to pull out and convey to ourselves or others. While the first image evinces the representation/capture of a human, the second evinces a thought event in relation to the human. For us this means, in the wake of <a href="#p2" title="Play 2: Images of humans in videogames" target="_blank">Play 2</a>, beyond that sample of what is an endless supply of visual images of people doing things, we can <em>think with</em> videogames to generate images of <em>the</em> human or humanity. This can be done in reference to specific instances and I will provide three examples.</div>
	<ol>		
		<li><em>Street Fighter V</em> <span class="reference">(Nakayama <a href="r.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>)</span> gives us an image of the possibilities of human coordination and anatomy through the input commands of special moves, e.g. <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/582165470?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" target="_blank">Ryu's Shoryuken</a>. This human image emerges from thinking about game mechanics and input commands.</li>
		<li>The story of <em>The Last of Us</em> <span class="reference">(Straley and Druckmann <a href="r.html#Straley 2013" target="_blank" title="Straley B and Druckmann N (directors) (2013) The last of us [videogame]">2013</a>)</span> performs a reversal of Christian atonement and eschatology to probe the problem of evil and human suffering. This human image is identified in narrative and themes.</li>
		<li><em>Spelunky 2's</em> <span class="reference">(Yu <a href="r.html#Yu 2020" target="_blank" title="Yu D (director) (2020) Spelunky 2 [videogame]">2020</a>)</span> randomly generated levels force players to cope with systems, rather than scripted spaces, generating a Kantian image of human knowledge where ‘receptivity can make knowledge possible only when combined with spontaneity’ <span class="reference">(Kant <a href="r.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>:A97-A98)</span>. This human image comes out of a creative association between Kant's <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>:121-169)</span> ‘Transcendental Deduction’ and <em>Spelunky 2</em>.</li>
	</ol>
<div>We can also be less specific by posing the question of the human to videogames in general. The gamer might be a bricoleur where ‘… the rule of his game is always to make do with “whatever is at hand”’ <span class="reference">(Lévi–Strauss <a href="r.html#Lévi–Strauss 1962" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1962/2021) Wild thought: a new translation of la pensée sauvage">1962/2021</a>:21)</span> or videogames might expand the possibilities of our sense of self, extending the ‘horizon within which I am capable of taking a stand’ <span class="reference">(Taylor <a href="r.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:27)</span>. And all these are to show how we might generate novel ways of considering humanity via the videogame, for each instance of a videogame can be made to speak to the question of human possibility and the phenomenon of videogames as a whole represents a human striving for new possibility spaces.</div>
<br>
<div>This second type of videogame image (which I just demonstrated in the above theoretical extensions of the videogame towards an image of the human or humanity) these are of another order relative to the loud and stimulating human images of the first type in <a href="#p2" title="Play 2: Images of humans in videogames" target="_blank">Play 2</a>. My examples of the first type are images I generated through playing videogames. I recorded the footage using this HDMI video capture card, which I purchased on eBay for $15.95:</div>

<div>This device constitutes a unique anthropological and ethnographic opportunity, an unprecedented technique ‘for the representation of social and cultural life’ <span class="reference">(Marcus <a href="r.html#Marcus 1986" target="_blank" title="Marcus GE (1986) ‘Afterword: Ethnographic Writing and Anthropological Careers’, in Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography">1986</a>:264)</span> only possible in videogames, as will be shown. My examples of the second type are images I generated later, after the fact, play, dialogue, capture, question and creative contemplation of the first type, in reference to the human condition. Beyond playing videogames, I generated these second images as ideas and associations to demonstrate the portrayal of what could be called a second-order human image, i.e. the fruition (image) of a thought event that emerges from an image event (the image event being a videogame or videogames).</div>
<br>
<div>Videogames entail and make possible certain styles of thought, unique to the phenomenon as ‘a becoming’ <span class="reference">(Bergson <a href="r.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1907/2015) Creative Evolution">1907/2015</a>:170)</span> with other human agents. In the same way, anthropology can be said to tend towards its own unique ways of thinking and dialogue. And anthropology entails an image of the human, i.e. the ethnography, which is radically different from what is presented in videogames. Nevertheless, both entail the performance of an image event. I have made an effort throughout this document not to favour an anthropological image or way of thinking over the videogame, as a seperate and unique mode of orienting us in relation to the human. Like anthropology, videogames are to think and perform an image of the human.</div>
<br>
<div>I have called this document an image and here, at this early stage, it is appropriate to state exactly what it is an image of. It is both an image of the videogame and the human (an anthropological image) to the same extent. Because I will argue the videogame to be a human event, it is not inaccurate to say, more simply, that this document is an image of the human.  But the videogame will require and inspire us to find new ways of doing anthropology, which is why I say it is a new anthropological image.</div>
