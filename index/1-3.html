	<h3>1-3 The Videogame as Human Event (a)</h3>

<div>All of the images described in <a href="1-1.html" title="1-1 A New Anthropological Image" target="_blank">‘1-1 A New Anthropological Image’</a> can be viewed as reductions of an event; none of them perfectly convey the experience of what it is like to play a videogame or to participate in the videogame image. If our objective is a perfect conveyance of the human videogame experience, it would be better for my reader to simply play a videogame and not read any further (I recommend <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> <span class="reference">(Ito <a href ="r.html#Ito 2000" title="Ito H (director) (2000) Final fantasy ix" target="blank">2000</a>)</span>). This is an essential distinction for what follows. So far, we have seen how there are multiple ways of construing an image of (or with) the videogame, in addition to the videogame image itself. There are multiple ways of performing the reduction. Each one pushes into relief different elements of, or assumes different stances in relation to, the event; some of these are obvious while others take effort and creativity. Videogames draw attention to the inadequacy of all these images as aftermaths of an irreducible event (and also reveal images themselves to be events when they are regarded in a specific way; this is one of our objectives). Anyone who has played a videogame before can feel the non-performance of that frame-by-frame reproduction of events (re)produced by my HDMI video capture card. While playing a videogame, the image-as-separate-object, notwithstanding its dazzling and crucial role in the experience of playing a videogame, is always subordinate to the image-as-experienced-event. Playing a videogame entails relinquishing the graphically computer generated representational liquid-crystal photon object, so we can enter into a shared (pre)configured event with other humans via gaming consoles, computers, controllers, monitors, etc. In this way, videogames are the apotheosis of a new orientation the human is assuming in relation to images; the image is an event, it is what we do, it is not a thing to be described, or even that which describes or represents. I become with (I am) the image – the transcendental image.</div>
<br>
<div>In this way, the videogame is a burgeoning and evolving medium for images that betrays traditional concepts of the image, notwithstanding the content found in videogame images, and the discourse surrounding the videogame's obsession with appraising image-objects. These modes should be insufficient for an anthropological treatment of videogames. An obvious anthropological question apropos of videogames should be something like, ‘How is the videogame changing humanity's orientation vis-à-vis images?’, and while this question will be addressed in what follows to varying extents, these will serve to support a more radical imperative, closer to the videogame as a phenomenon: Describe the videogame-human-image-event. This description is the terminus of process that consists of dismantling the concept of the image to reveal a series of complex human events. The image is, then, not an object separate from our means of understanding it. And I will follow through on those epistemological implications here: the image is not a distinct phenomenon to be understood in different ways – from one perspective it is an object, from another it is an event – rather, different ways of thinking, positions or orientations will regard different events to be their image. What ‘image’ means is dynamic and signals a way of thinking. A familiar example would be how memories, projections and fantasies each involve different styles of thought, styles that precede their image and not the other way around. Descartes’ <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> philosophy frames our experience of the world as a series of images we receive via our sensory organs, but here experience comprises of images because of the way Descartes has thought about said experience. This dualism does not describe how we usually orient ourselves in relation to the events of daily life. If I see someone fall off their bike, I move to see if they are okay and regard myself as part of that transpiring event; I do not consider it to be an image. The Cartesian image entails a particular way of thinking which separates me, my thinking mind as experiencer and decision maker, from external events.</div> 
<br>
<!-- I establish a distance through the abstraction (construction) on an isolated sense of self, distinct from the suffering other who fell off their bike. -->

</figure><!-- Play 3: image of a suffering other who fell of their bike -->
<br>
<div>And <a href="#p3" title="Play 3: A suffering other who fell of their bike">Play 3</a> is not a videogame. And despite the philosophical and ideological context in which each videogame phenomena is couched, the videogame, as a medium, is to perform the image as a performance to perform and not as an object to behold — at least temporarily, at least while we are intently playing a videogame.</div>
<br>
<div>Here is the point: playing a videogame entails a forgetting of the image as a separate thing to be looked at; we enter into a becoming with the image as a human event. Thus, anthropology is Eros, sent to kill Psyche but the two will fall in love. It will happen like this: to approach videogames with anthropological concerns (videogames as human events, not objects) involves the conveyance of the image as an event – making the realism and spectacle of the image as an object recede in our descriptions, corresponding and in response to the way it recedes while, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/5JSIyrVONmM?t=291" target="_blank">battling Satsuki</a> in <em>Demon's Souls</em> <span class="reference">(Moore <a href="r.html#Moore 2020" target="_blank" title="Moore G (director) (2020) Demon’s souls [videogame]">2020</a>)</span>. To approach anthropology with videogame concerns thus entails a new anthropology detached from the image, a new anthropological performance. Anthropology and the videogame, these two lovers, will here (this is one of our objectives) rediscover themselves and unlock new potentialities through each other. It is true love! This project is to let videogames happen to anthropology (and anthropology to videogames). Following what the videogame image invites us to do, we can find a new perspective that is a new plane of human possibility: a truly <em>new</em> image. It will be an image that is an event, a videogame, a process of thinking, a performance-image that is a description of some constituents of human experience, a description of the image <em>as</em> human experience, a shared performance of <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em>, the reading and the writing and the playing – I got the idea playing videogames.</div>
<br>
<div id="1.3p4">This new dialogic image process can start by distinguishing the events which make up our conception of an image. These include (1) consuming an image, (2) producing an image and (3) the event that an image is of. These each still treat the image as an object in relation to some human process but remember this is only our starting point. Their more detailed description, the production of more complex depictions of the phenomena will reveal how, each the three events taken in isolation, attaches their imagined and insufficient  image-object to one of the other three events for subsistence. For example, when I am (1) consuming an image, I regard the image, the thing I am beholding, to emerge from either how the image was or is being produced or whatever the image is of. When you are in the process of (2) producing an image, by ‘I am making this image’ you mean you are creating some user/viewer experience for <em>consumption</em> or that you are <em>capturing</em> the likeness of some event which is more than your generative representation process can ever encompass. Finally, while we are concerned with (3) the event that an image is of, we are either not thinking about the image at all — we are like Heidegger's <!-- reference -->carpenter with a hammer, immersed in his labour — or we are regarding the experience's failure, via production or consumption, to encompass the infinite nature of the non-image event.</div>
<br>
<div>This is to demonstrated what I said above, that what constitutes an image (and thus what we find after closer inspection) will depend on our position or the event we are currently engaged in. When the events constituting the image of each perspective are described, the image is revealed to be a collection of events. We will also find that, producing the image, consuming the image and the event that an image is of are not mutually exclusive, that they are in many ways equivalent and that the third event, whatever the image is of (which can also encompass the first two) is more, infinitely more, than whatever we could mean by ‘this image’. The videogame forces these three events to coalesce, for the videogame event is always all three at once in the moment we are playing a videogame, and this is what makes the videogame a special human event leading to anthropology's future infatuation and affair with the videogame, overcoming both parties most egregious vices.</div>
<br>
<!-- The act of gameplay invites us to think in different terms, on the videogame’s terms, which can redeem our participation in image events. -->

</figure><!-- Play 4: Harvesting a little sister -->
<br>
<div>This is not so because of a new perspective which reveals greater context. There is no redemption for our two image-generating technologies (videogames and anthropology) in these kinds of encompassing gestures: the significance of the image I triggered is reduced via its position in a larger context, we can see <em>more</em> than an image by virtue of the monitor and surrounding apparatus brought into focus, it is a <em>mere</em> image. Getting underneath the image-event is not enough because this only performs another reduction, generates another image, namely an image of the events of an image. <a href="#p4" title="Play 4: Harvesting a Little Sister">Play 4</a> shows us this. Rather, I will paint the image as both an event which reduces something and an irreducible event in itself by making explicit the dialogic image we, yes you, reader, are making right now. Here, ‘reduction event’ refers not only to that which I accused the image of in the <a href="#1.3" title="All of the images described in the first section of this level can be viewed as reductions of an event; none of them perfectly convey the experience of what it is like to play a videogame or to participate in the videogame image." target="_blank">first paragraph of this section</a> — to regard/generate an enclosed image is to reduce and enclose an irreducible event — it also refers to the blatant reduction of suffering otherness expressed in <a href="#p4" title="Play 4: Harvesting a Little Sister">Play 4</a>, which is an image, not an aggregate. The images we must reframe into new image-events are those that constitute a particular stance of feigned non-participation; not playing a videogame, not producing an image by consuming it, not consuming an image by producing it, making the image be <em>of</em> some event with a totalising scope it will never fulfil. In the videogame image-event, the act of playing a videogame — in the performing of a <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> <span class="reference">(Motomura <a href="r.html#Motomura 2018" target="_blank" title="Motomura J (director) (2018) Dragon Ball FighterZ [videogame]">2018</a>)</span> <a href="https://youtu.be/x2ZMEWtBc6s?t=42" target="_blank">combo string</a> — <em>there is no external event or object to be reduced</em>. Image (1) production, (2) consumption and (3) the event that an image is of, become a single performance or human event. The reduction event, as an act of orienting ourselves in relation to ‘that image’ (an otherness reduced to finitude) is never the end product. It happens along the way into the event of the videogame image itself (or an anthropological image). Rather than objectively critiquing the image as a separate object, we reorient the image event by way of direct participation and say something like, <em>this is not over</em>. The performance of reduction is not attacked but creatively redeemed within the human imagination of the dialogic act of the videogame image-event, which we, as participants (players), are a part of.</div>
<br>
<div>And by ‘redeemed’ here I mean that we have justified the image event as a transcendental condition of engagement. The performance of an image (not necessarily a videogame image) is how we will reorient ourselves vis-à-vis the otherness <a href="#p4" title="Play 4: Harvesting a Little Sister">Play 4</a> has failed to represent in the footage of harvesting a Little Sister in <em>Bioshock</em> <span class="reference">(Levine <a href="r.html#Levine 2007" target="_blank" title="Levine K (2007) (director) Bioshock [videogame]">2007</a>)</span>

<br>
<div>There is an irreverence to the juxtaposition of all these images. But the videogame image will become less trivial and the anthropological image will become more of a participation and more of a playing. And the videogame images are fictional unlike the scholarly images, but they all entail a performance that is some kind of a participation in the general phenomenon that is violence and the human condition. Further, as actors in contact with and negotiating the otherness of suffering, we are compelled to continue to correct our failed representations that trail behind our disparate desperate engagements; we do not need to keep playing <em>Bioshock</em> necessarily but as we <em>will</em> keep generating images, we will keep participating in image events. I will discourage any resistance to this process (this is one of our objectives) and affirm a shared responsibility, bestowed by the haunting and incomprehensible otherness we experience through the set of events we regard as an image, to <strong>make another image</strong>.</div>
<br>
<div>And our source of greatest redemption is that we are not alone in these endeavours. I feel this now and you should too. For example, I have described this text as an image which is a signification of my stance as its author. I, as author, am not in a position to redeem this document from its failings to accurately represent what I have set out to describe. But the act of reading can be regarded as a creative event in the same way my act of writing is. The instance of reading is where I must hope <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em> can be redeemed, as an event which you are a part of and which you make unfinished. We read texts and participate in images in new ways, we extend them as dialogic events, in order to redeem them; we condemn them and ourselves hypocritically, in contradictions and binaries, by framing a static image.</div>
<br>
<div>And this is how far we will get in this document – that was a small way of performing what I hope to achieve here. The image, as a set of events, will not be described sufficiently for the gesture of this entire document until much later, until the various events which make up the image have been explored and described along a trajectory. The upshot of that trajectory occurs towards the end of the <a href="3.1.html#3" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">third level</a>. I will now anticipate some elements of the experience of that level for my reader, to the extent that those elements are relevant to these early stages of the document and for my reader's bearing of the whole.</div>
