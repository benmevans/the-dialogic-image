	<h3>1-4 In Anticipation of ‘<a href="3-1.html" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Even" target="_blank">3 Violence: The Videogame Event</a>’ Which Concerns the Event that an Image is Of</h3>
		
<div>The third level titled ‘<a href="3-1.html" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">3 Violence: The Videogame Event</a>’ is to redeem the image-event in response to the line of thought to which that level is dedicated, where the image emerges in its most problematic state as a kind of violence. This framing emerges from an exploration of the events which constitute a videogame image, performed in the level before it, ‘<a href="2-1.html" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image" target="_blank">2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image</a>’. Here is a fast way into what this third and culminating level will do, though the actual performance will take the long route, viz. the entire document up to that point: abstracting the image into events invites a number of distinctions to be made: the difference between the image being conveyed through prose and the act of playing a videogame, between what is being displayed on the screen and the act of playing a videogame, between an image and the event that an image is of, between an image of an actor pretending to be shot in the head,</div>

<br>	
<div>and someone being shot in the head.</div>
<br>
<div>We can regard my performance of an image of a man being shot in the head with <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> <span class="reference">(Druckmann et al. <a href="r.html#Druckmann 2020" target="_blank" title="Druckmann N, Newman A and Margenau K (directors) (2020) The last of us part ii [videogame]">2020</a>)</span>, as less violent because of its proximity to the footage of Nguyễn Văn Lém's execution. The historical footage of an actual event of violence makes that rasterized and pretended violence of the videogame image seem fake and trivial. This is one way to think of it, and it is the way I thought things would go before I edited the above video. However, now that it is here, my experience of this image is unexpected, though I can only speak for myself. I played a larger role in the making of this image than my reader, so I am differently oriented, which might be why I see the influence these images have on each other in the reverse. That is, the image of an execution I performed in <em>Part II</em> is <em>not</em> made to feel less real as a result of its juxtaposition to the footage of Nguyễn Văn Lém. <em>Part II's</em> violence could not be made less real for me. At no stage during my playing of the game, or watching or editing the recording, did I assume a real execution was transpiring or had transpired in reference to that image of Ellie shooting an NPC (non-player character). Rather, <em>Part II</em> brings the captured war footage into alignment with it, as another mere image, another futile attempt at conveying the termination (or explosion) of otherness that occurs when a bullet passes through someone's brain. Being in a position to manipulate the image, feeling the burden of being someone who produces the violent image (as one is while playing a videogame), changes our orientation towards the image. The image is then of the process we went through to produce it more than it is of the event it is supposed to represent. <em>Part II</em> has more colour and detail, but we, as viewers, bring different contexts to how we experience the image. The Vietnam footage is more violent because we know it really happened, that Nguyễn Văn Lém and Major General Nguyễn Ngọc Loan were real people. But if we are explicitly producing the image and are aware of our contributions to it, we do not put faith in the concealed movements of a camera, we know where the image came from, and that any image can only point towards some irreducible human event, which it cannot encompass. Someone passes in front of the camera, just as Nguyễn Ngọc Loan pulls the trigger, we have only this angle, we have only this many frames, this resolution, such distance, the list goes on forever; we have everything there is to work with, we can slow things down or zoom in, insert a more realistic gunshot sound, add ambience, place it next to some other image and see how that changes our experience, we tailor an experience. To make the image of the begging NPC, I killed all his friends then shot him in the hand to disarm him - that's when they start to beg - and I made that image of violence just for the sake of this paragraph and to experience and contrast rasterization and film in a single violent image. The association established in that video works to invalidate the associating of either image with a violent event. Both images fail to represent real violence. We might have already known this in reference to the videogame image, but now the historical image is there too; I put it in the video.</div>
<br>         
<div><a href="3-1.html" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">‘3 Violence: The Videogame Event’</a> will express a concern for the image’s failings in this regard, irrespective of the image's source (videogame, camera or otherwise), namely the image's universal failure to encompass the irreducible event of violence. The event that is the experience of the image (consumption) and the event which generates the image (production) will have been dealt with earlier for their own sakes at the in the <a href="2-1.html" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image" target="_blank">second level</a>. In the <a href="3-1.html" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">third</a>, we will address the image’s claims that it is of some event beyond the image, specifically violence. In this way, the violent event that an image is of can be thought of as the object of the image’s intrusion and that which the image occludes. The violent image – as something to behold and as a concept – is the performance or participation in an event that reduces and hides the event of suffering otherness through the process of production and consumption, the event/s of the image. I disassociate the violent image from the violent event, via videogames, in response to this hostile gesture. This allows the violent image to be framed as a dynamic event for us, rather than a thing to behold; it can be a way of perpetually orienting ourselves in relation to the other and human suffering. As an event, we can regard the violent image’s claims to have captured or conveyed otherness as but one orientation, and we can find an unfinished, less reductive bearing with videogames. This bearing was described in the <a href="1-3.html" title="1-3 The Videogame as Human Event (a)" target="_blank">previous section</a>. However, that section’s succinctness does not embroil us into the problematic of the violent image, as the culmination of a description of the image as an event.</div>
<br>
<div>For that participation to occur, I give my reader this entire document, which follows my own trajectory of thought. With that in mind, it is better to start with familiar conditions. Everything described up to this point has come out of a clarification and refinement of the distinction between the <em>event</em> and the <em>image</em> – not being initially particular about the term <em>image</em>, leaving it to my reader's intuition (as all writing and language must do on some level), the colloquial image, the image on your screen, the billboard, <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em> <span class="reference">(Vermeer <a href="r.html#Vermeer 1665" target="_blank" title="Vermeer J (1665) Girl with a pearl earing [painting]">1665</a>)</span>,</div>

<br>
<div>– and favouring the event, the act of looking in the mirror, the performance, as more real than what we isolate to be the human image. The image as an object (Sam or V's reflection in <a href="#p7" title="Play 7: The human in the mirror in the videogame" target="_blank">Play 7</a>, that which is on our screen) is what we are seeking to point beyond - to eventually disclose the image as an irreducible event in itself and not ‘a representation… [which] has its actual existence in something other than itself’ <span class="reference">(Hegel <a href="r.html#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>:273)</span>. We start with the assertion that the image is less real, or that there is a falseness to the image, a failure whenever we regard it as being <em>of</em> something – ‘Ceci n'est pas une pipe’ <span class="reference">(Magritte <a href="r.html#Magritte 1929" target="_blank" title="Magritte R (1929) The treachery of images [painting]">1929</a>)</span>. In response to the empirically subsisting image, we seek to describe the Real, namely the concrete events we find connected to it.</div>
<br>		
<div>This is not a distinction Baudrillard <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>:1)</span> made in his description of simulacra, as ‘the generation by models of a real without origin or reality’. Baudrillard describes our postmodern saturation in images as essentially non-specific pertaining to the real. Contrarily, I start from an imperative to convey something that is more than an image, and which could be described as specifically real compared to an image, especially in relation to violent images like the ones generated in <a href="1-1.html#p2" title="Play 2: Images of humans in videogames" target="_blank">Play 2</a> (images of humans in videogames), <a href="1-3.html#p4" title="Play 4: Harvesting a Little Sister" target="_blank">Play 4</a> (harvesting a Little Sister), <a href="1-3.html#p5" title="Play 5: Igor's failed suicide attempt" target="_blank">Play 5</a> (Igor's failed suicide attempt) or <a href="1-4.html#p6" title="Play 6: Two violent images (rasterized and filmed)" target="_blank">Play 6</a> (two violent images <span class="reference">(rasterized and filmed)</span>). In this mode, an event is real compared to its image regardless of that image’s ambitions to simulate, or successes in simulating, any aspect of reality. Regarding my motivations behind and decisions in writing ‘<a href="3-1.html" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">3 Violence: The Videogame Event</a>’ as the upshot of this process, I commence with a concern for that which has been recorded (not the recording), in the case of actual documented events. An example of this is the final clip in <a href="1-4.html#p6" title="Play 6: Two violent images (rasterized and filmed)" target="_blank">Play 6</a> in which Nguyễn Ngọc Loan famously kills Nguyễn Văn Lém. In the case of fictional images, like those found in films and videogames, the event I am referring to is that which is being portrayed (not the portrayal). Ellie is a fictional character but the concepts of death, murder, human suffering, etc. are still being portrayed and reduced in the <a href="1-4.html#p6" title="Play 6: Two violent images (rasterized and filmed)" target="_blank">above gameplay footage</a>. My first drafts of <a href="3-1.html" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">this third level</a> intended to describe the events as more real than (existing independently from) the images which portray or capture them. This moves against Baudrillard’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>:6)</span> hyperreal, i.e. the rejection of ‘any distinction between the real and the imaginary’. If a simulacrum ‘has no relation to any reality whatsoever’ <span class="reference">(Baudrillard <a href="r.html#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>:6)</span>, there are no pure simulacra here, for I have a mind to exhaust the description of images down into their real events with videogames. This, in a sense, is to reframe our contributions to the image in a way that allows the image to become real. There is always a connection to an irreducible event, be it what is portrayed by the image of a headshot, or the gameplay event that is captured.</div>
<br>
<div>Real does not function here as a truth claim. More than Baudrillard’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>)</span> references to the real, real is our most familiar term for distinguishing an image from the inexhaustible event that image is of (this was the first distinction I made during research). The breaking up of the image into separate human events could also be described as a critique of the image, in search of some real event hidden therein. We need this initial critique in order to affirm something beyond the text itself, beyond the image being produced by the author. For example, Kant’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>)</span> noumena, Wittgenstein’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Wittgenstein 1921" target="_blank" title="Wittgenstein L (1921/2014) Tractatus logico-philosophicus">1921/2014</a>:89)</span> ‘what we cannot speak about’ and Gabriel Marcel’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:55-56)</span> meta-problematic, are thought of as fulfilling this role in their respective philosophical systems or styles. Dilworth refers to this apparently necessary limiting case as simplicity: ‘I say that I think something is completely simple, only because I have really nothing to say of it than merely that it is something’ <span class="reference">(Kant cited in Dilworth <a href="r.html#Dilworth 2013" target="_blank" title="">2013</a>:15)</span>. Without this kind of critique with its implicit parameters (viz. a reaching for something which is not to be described in the last instance, something which does not and cannot reside within the text itself, Shestov’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Shestov 1916" title="Shestov L (1916) Penultimate words and other essays" target="_blank">1916</a>)</span> last word) there is a lack of significance to whatever occurs and is accomplished. Whether Borges’ <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Borges 1946" target="_blank" title="Borges JL (1946/1999) Collected fictions">1946/1999</a>:325)</span> map, as simulation/representation/image, ‘precedes the territory’ <span class="reference">(Baudrillard <a href="r.html#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>:1)</span> which is real, or if there is no longer any distinction between the map and the terrain itself, we must locate for ourselves a distinction. We always need some infinite concept beyond the text or beyond the image, which overflows it, for the image to be about. On this, I do not need to be specific, beyond separating it out from the events of the image, for it is simply the event that an image is of.</div>
<br>
<div>More than a clarification of this project's scope and mission — i.e. to establish the pursuit of something beyond what is reproduced by my HDMI video capture card — this distinction between image and event, and the assertion that an image like this one has the potential to point towards and invite readers into an event, that this image itself can be regarded as such, is necessary to justify the project to itself. Otherwise I might just give my reader a few hundred hours of gameplay footage to watch, it being a perfect replication of the event in one narrow sense. But I have designed the image that is this document to be more than a Let’s Play and more than an example of Gillen’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Gillen 2004" target="_blank" title="Gillen K (23 March 2004) 'The new games Journalism', Kieron Gillen's workblog">2004</a>)</span> ‘new dogma… 1) The worth of gaming lies in the gamer not the game. 2) Write travel journalism to Imaginary Places’ – no; this image will perform an explicit invitation towards the Real, i.e. towards an inter-human event, even as this document can be regarded as an event.</div>
<br>
<div>Of course, every image is an invitation to the event of its consumption, be it a dialogic and creative consumption or otherwise. Within the parameters of its text, this document is an invitation to the former, to regard the reading of it as a means of participating in a human event. Beyond what can be contained in text and recordings of gameplay footage, it is also an invitation to think with and play videogames, to think about the human through videogames in new and unprecedented ways, which extend beyond the scope of this project. For, as I have said, what I produce here, from my perspective, is a mere image. That is, I am reducing two events, the act of this document being read and the real event I am trying to describe, in order to perform the gesture of writing it.</div>
