	<h3>1-5 In Anticipation of ‘<a href="2-1.html" target="_blank" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image">2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image</a>’ Which Concerns the Producing and Consuming of an Image</h3>
		
<div>The second level of this document, titled ‘<a href="2-1.html" target="_blank" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image">2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image</a>’, is dedicated to the other two events I associated with the image in ‘<a href="1-3.html#1.3p4" target="_blank" title="1-3 The Videogame as Human Event">1-3 The Videogame as Human Event (a)</a>’, namely consuming and producing the videogame image. In one sense, we could say these two events <em>are</em> the image, they are the image happening, they <em>subsist</em>. While the event that an image is of exists independent of its reduction into an image, these two events begin – this is the state in which I found them – as the performance of that reduction. Further, they are first recognised as constituents of the image; they share a naive genesis with the image, as a thing to be described, of which they are a part.</div>
<br>		
<div>The first drafts of this <a href="2-1.html" target="_blank" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image">second level</a> came out of an intention to describe a part of the videogame image in preparation for the real human event of videogames, to be described later. However, the process of writing, and all that that entails, uncovered these ‘parts’ of the image as human events in their own right. We can think of, then, the image-as-problematic-object-to-be-described’s retreat into the third level, where it is destroyed or where the whole image becomes a set of events for us. So, ‘<a href="2-1.html" target="_blank" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image">2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image</a>’ is to discover the first two elements of the image as complex <em>dialogic</em> and <em>embodied</em> events; a setting out to describe the image only to discover events.</div>
<br>		
<div>This is how we get to the problem of violence, the violence of beholding and reducing the suffering other, addressed in the <a href="3-1.html" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">third level</a>. The image, as an event we orient our bodies towards, is stimulating because of the way it can occlude that process, the body of the beholder is concealed in the image. The image pulls us away from our bodies towards a Cartesian abstraction. This abstraction is not the by-product of consuming an image but how the image is experienced, how it is generated. This also entails our passing over and dismissing the body of the suffering other, an otherness which cannot be replicated with pixels, a suffering which can only be seen by placing ourselves, our bodies, in its path.</div>
<br>		
<div>The role of the body in the event of consuming the image is also how the image is produced, for we enter an event with the image’s author, fulfilling what they have anticipated. In videogames, this event becomes explicitly dialogic and radically unresolved. ‘<a href="2-1.html" target="_blank" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image">2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image</a>’ uses <em>Street Fighter</em> <span class="reference">(Funamizu et al. <a href="r.html#Funamizu 1995" target="_blank" title="Funamizu N, Murata H and Itsuno H (designers) (1995) Street fighter alpha 3 [videogame]">1995</a>; Nakayama <a href="r.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>; Nishiyama <a href="r.html#Nishiyama 1987" target="_blank" title="Nishiyama T (director) (1987) Street fighter [videogame]">1987</a>; Okamoto <a href="r.html#Okamoto 1991" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y (director) (1991) Street fighter II [videogame]">1991</a>; Okamoto et al. <a href="r.html#Okamoto 1999" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y, Funamizu N and Nakajima (producers) (1999) Street fighter III: 3rd strike [videogame]">1999</a>; Tsukamoto <a href="r.html#Tsukamoto 2008" target="_blank" title="Tsukamoto T (director) (2008) Street fighter IV [videogame]">2008</a>)</span> to discover the inter-human dialogic event in the phenomenon of the image. This is done by contrasting the videogame-image with the movement-image of cinema, as Deleuze <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>; <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>)</span> describes it. The videogame does not fulfil Deleuze’s descriptions of real movement in cinema, but real movement is discovered through an interactivity, unique to videogames.</div>
