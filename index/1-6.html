	<h3>1-6 Anthropology's Ignorance of the Videogame</h3>
		
<div>The videogame is not an obvious problematic per se for social/cultural anthropology or anthropologies outside or resisting these identifiers, from philosophical anthropologies like Buber’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Buber 1965" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1965) The knowledge of man">1965</a>)</span> or Scheler’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Scheler 1928" target="_blank" title="Scheler M (1928/2009) The human place in the cosmos">1928/2009</a>)</span> to any post-human descendant of the ontological turn. It will be shown that the videogame, in the way I am arguing we approach it, is not a priority within the interlocutions of the discipline wherever we place its parameters.</div>

<br>		
<div>The present unarticulated assumption among anthropologists, to be qualified below, goes like this: defining and describing videogames is best left to those who are expert in their development and application; anthropology’s problematic does not pertain to the videogame itself, but rather the social phenomena surrounding and within it.</div>
<br>		
<div>I can sympathise with the motivations behind the former – let those people define the things they are doing and making for themselves. It was not Lienhardt’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>)</span> place to formulate some new conception of the master of the fishing spear’s spears, after all. The spears, as formulated by the Dinka, contributed to Lienhardt’s descriptions of one instance of humanity orienting itself in relation to Divinity or ultra-human forces. This is in the same way the shrine and spears, conveyed in an example of Lienhardt’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>:plate VI)</span> famous photography, were constituents of an image of the human, forming an essential part of that image, with the mother and child standing over to the left… </div>
<br>
<figure>
	<img src="Figure 4.png" alt="dinka" border="0" class="center">
	<figcaption class="small"><a href="r.html#Lienhardt 1961" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">Figure 4</a>: Mother and child in <em>Divinity and Experience</em>
	</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>	
<div>The problematic would then be to position the videogame, as a cultural object, in relation to the human, so as to form a new image. This is how Thornham’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Thornham 2011" target="_blank" title="Thornham H (2011) Ethnographies of the videogame: gender, narrative and praxis">2011</a>:10)</span> Ethnographies of the Videogame is positioned, where ‘interviews, reflections, and the recordings of gameplay’ in eleven UK households, constitute her entire methodological gesture. <em>Playing</em> a videogame to understand the human, as participant observation, as ethnographic engagement, is not conceived as part of Thornham’s project. In discussions surrounding the videogame’s legitimacy as art <span class="reference">(see Golding <a href="r.html#Golding 2011" target="_blank" title="Golding D (2011) ‘Not art you say?: in defence of videogames’">2011</a>; Ndi <a href="r.html#Ndi 2019" target="_blank" title="Ndi A (2019) ‘Rethinking video games in critical discourse: re-visiting intersections of the ICT hypertext and artistic consumption’">2019</a>)</span>, the game is positioned as an artwork, even when nobody is playing it. In these cases, including Thornham’s, the videogame is a thing to be grasped, appraised, analysed, etc. A distance is presupposed and a comparability and containment are bestowed upon human experience to generate specimens.</div>
<br>		
<div>But this is counter to what I have found to be most interesting and valuable in a study of videogames and ignores what makes them unique. So much for defining and describing videogames: videogames discourage these objectifications in the act of playing them. It is only after the fact or before it, when the game is not happening, that we can imagine it as a static phenomenon to be defined, critiqued, and compared to other instances of the videogame or even other art forms.</div>
<br>		
<div>But anthropology’s greatest contributions to the videogame, and the videogame’s greatest contributions to anthropology, will not be found in a style of thought focused on the definition, function or appraisal of a new cultural object. When the videogame is regarded as a thing to be understood, it is essentially extraneous to our application of the anthropological question (What is the human being? <span class="reference">(Kant <a href="r.html#Kant 1765" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1765/1992) Lectures on logic">1765/1992</a>:538)</span>), the question I will seek to apply to videogames. It is context, extra details, but not where we are pointing the question, not a human event of which the researcher can become a part. In this way, I am suggesting we acknowledge an agency in the videogame, as a human event, as its own form of an answer to the anthropological question and as a new way of asking the question (contra Kant’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Kant 1765" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1765/1992) Lectures on logic">1765/1992</a>:538)</span> way of asking the question).</div>
<br>		
<div>Videogames ought not to simply function within the social structure we ensconce them. In a way that is more obvious than film or any art form (the art status of videogames is tangential) videogames entail an independent network of actors (Latour), which makes them radically unresolved. Of course, we can say that everything is unresolved but being unresolved is the videogame’s premise, its first principle, the starting point of our experience with the medium. I say videogames are radically unresolved because any other articulation ignores how they must be regarded to experience them; to perform the event we must regard this image as indeterminate. In the case of a film or novel we can be oblivious to the indeterminate nature of the thing – the book is sitting on my desk; it is a static object. The videogame has parameters, the code, hardware, etc., but the goal is to hide these; they are what you forget in order to make the videogame happen, they recede to bring forth an event.</div>
<br>		
<div>This means videogames can teach a style of thought which regards other mediums and thought projects to be events as well. For example, our explicit participation in the production of a videogame-image can make clear our implicit participation in the cinema, the ‘movement-image’ <span class="reference">(Deleuze <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>)</span>. Compared to spears, shrines, paintings, films, and even some interpretations of anthropology, videogames are still in the making in a more obvious sense. And this can constitute a useful thought exercise we might apply beyond the videogame. It can lead us to think dialogically, towards a pregnant otherness, regarding things as not having fully happened yet and no instance of happening is identical. This is an aside and not a philosophical argument, I am not using videogames to do an ontology. The videogame demands a new way of thinking, but I have no intention to apply that beyond videogames and anthropology.</div>
<br>		 
<div>The videogame is unresolved, but of course there are identical screen states. The context and role of those states in the unfolding dialogue between player, developer and device are never the same. When I spawned into <em>Demon's Souls'</em> <span class="reference">(Moore <a href="r.html#Moore 2020" target="_blank" title="Moore G (director) (2020) Demon’s souls [videogame]">2020</a>)</span> Shrine of Storms at Black World Tendency for the forty-third time, the screen’s pixels assumed exactly the same state as the first time, but it was not the same.  Playing a videogame and reflecting on the event itself discourages determining articulations in a way that is only comparable to other software, dialogue, ritual, societies or the world.</div>
<br>		
<div>And by ‘the world’ here I mean everything, that is, ‘all that is the case’ <span class="reference">(Wittgenstein <a href="r.html#Wittgenstein 1921" target="_blank" title="Wittgenstein L (1921/2014) Tractatus logico-philosophicus">1921/2014</a>:5)</span>, because this project does not treat videogames as visitable locations in which social phenomena transpires. They are not the <em>scene</em> from Lienhardt’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>:plate VI)</span> photo in which the mother and child happen to be standing over to the left, in which the anthropologist has the opportunity to capture their unique position, their way, of being in the world.</div>
<br>		
<div>This is the more common position among social or cultural anthropologists, with the proviso that the videogame or similar is continuously online, so as to entail social continuity and meet Boellstorff’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Boellstorff 2014" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2014) ‘An afterward in four binarisms’">2014</a>:740; <a href="r.html#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:395)</span> criteria for a ‘virtual world’. Some examples of such ethnographies include Taylor’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Taylor 2006" target="_blank" title="Taylor TL (2006) Play between worlds: exploring online game culture">2006</a>)</span> <em>Play Between Worlds: Exploring Online Game Culture</em>, Boellstorff’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>)</span> own, <em>Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human</em>, Nardi's <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Nardi 2010" target="_blank" title="Nardi BA (2010) My life as a night elf priest: an anthropological account of World of Warcraft">2010</a>)</span> <em>My Life as a Night Elf Priest: An Anthropological Account of World of Warcraft</em>, Rowlands' <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Rowlands 2012" target="_blank" title="Rowlands T (2012) Video game worlds: working at play in the culture of EverQuest">2012</a>)</span> <em>Video Game Worlds: Working at Play in the Culture of EverQuest</em> and Sundén and Sveningsson's <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Sundén 2012" target="_blank" title="Sundén J and Sveningsson M (2012) Gender and sexuality in online game cultures: passionate play">2012</a>)</span> <em>Gender and Sexuality in Online Game Cultures</em>. But all these projects have entirely different objectives to the present one. That is, ethnographies like these are not anthropologies of the videogame; they are studies of or with the people who play videogames within a virtual world. Here, the videogame is accepted as a potential location in which social and cultural events can transpire. I do not directly dispute this assumption, but I do wish to point out that a more basic human event has been stepped over in the framing of the above projects, namely the videogame itself.</div>
<br>		
<div>The above projects have not questioned the videogame as a human event. They already have working conceptions of the videogame as a platform, which is evident in their methodologies, in how they regard ‘games like EverQuest [as] fundamentally social spaces’ <span class="reference">(Taylor <a href="r.html#Taylor 2006" target="_blank" title="Taylor TL (2006) Play between worlds: exploring online game culture">2006</a>:10)</span>, an ‘online fieldsite’ <span class="reference">(Boellstorff <a href="r.html#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>:5)</span> from which to collect or generate data through ‘normal anthropological methods including participant observation and interviews’ <span class="reference">(Boellstorff <a href="r.html#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>:4)</span>. To ‘take Second Life’s emergence as given and work to analyse the cultural practices and beliefs taking form within it’ <span class="reference">(Boellstorff <a href="r.html#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>:5, my italics)</span> is to prioritise the application of familiar methods over the unprecedented human event, the dialogic image, the rasterized image as new transcendental category, which occurs every time we turn on the PlayStation 5.</div>
<br>		
<div>If the videogame image was simply a cultural object or virtual fieldsite, we could just play <em>World of Warcraft</em> <span class="reference">(Dabiri and Guerrero <a href="r.html#Dabiri 2004" target="_blank" title="Dabiri S and Guerrero C (producers) (2004) World of warcraft [videogame]">2004</a>)</span> ourselves, do our own ‘frantic clicking [to] produce the salutary effect of killing the monster’, instead of reading Nardi's <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Nardi 2010" target="_blank" title="Nardi BA (2010) My life as a night elf priest: an anthropological account of World of Warcraft">2010</a>:5)</span> account. A gentleman reading <em>Witchcraft, oracles, and Magic Among the Azande</em> at Oxford in the late 1930s had no way of consulting a poison oracle himself, for it was as the Zande said: ‘perhaps in their country people are not murdered by witches, but here they are’ <span class="reference">(Evans-Pritchard <a href="r.html#Evans-Pritchard 1937" target="_blank" title="Evans-Pritchard EE (1937/1976) Witchcraft, oracles, and magic among the Azande">1937/1976</a>:221)</span>. ‘Here’, Zandeland, was Evans-Pritchard's <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Evans-Pritchard 1937" target="_blank" title="Evans-Pritchard EE (1937/1976) Witchcraft, oracles, and magic among the Azande">1937/1976</a>)</span> privilege, and his research has value today as a historical document for that aspect alone, even without its potential applications / tacit identifications of ‘webs of meaning’ in Western systems of thought. But when anthropology is applied to the production of digital images like videogames, historical documentation of human expression is not an ancillary function/appeal that can distract us, we are here for something else, some other type of image. Here, the theoretical picture becomes essential and Rowlands' <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Rowlands 2012" target="_blank" title="Rowlands T (2012) Video game worlds: working at play in the culture of EverQuest">2012</a>:157)</span> description of a Durkheimian division of labour in <em>EverQuest</em> <span class="reference">(McQuaid <a href="r.html#McQuaid 1999" target="_blank" title="McQuaid B (1999) EverQuest [videogame]">1999</a>)</span>, with its collectivist/individualist tensions and contradictions, is more important than descriptions of how the ‘enormous rhinoceroses wander obstinately across the horizon, accompanied by human-sized, golden-feathered cockatrices…’ <span class="reference">(Rowlands <a href="r.html#Rowlands 2012" target="_blank" title="Rowlands T (2012) Video game worlds: working at play in the culture of EverQuest">2012</a>:57)</span>. The latter is already present in a different text, a text which is closer to Wittgenstein's <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Wittgenstein 1921" target="_blank" title="Wittgenstein L (1921/2014) Tractatus logico-philosophicus">1921/2014</a>:25)</span> ambition for a logically perfect language, ‘a proposition which shows its sense’, namely the game itself, overtaking the limited significations of ethnographic prose.</div>
<br>		
<div>This is notwithstanding the auto-ethnographic value of a text too, where the ethnographic image is determined by and made subordinate to the researcher's point of entry. This includes when the researcher's subjectivity serves as the impetus for the framing of a sociological question, like in Sveningsson's <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Sveningsson 2012" target="_blank" title="Sveningsson M (2012) ‘Go with your passion!’">2012</a>:22)</span> case, ‘how female gamers experience the games, gaming activities and gaming cultures, from their perspective as female gamers’. This less ambitious, more specific than it is transcendental (Kant's <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>:A12)</span> ‘transcendental’), more personal, style of question is not fundamentally reflexive towards the evolution of the human condition through videogames in the way I intend. Rather, a question is being applied to a predefined, determinate, instance of the human – that which we talk about when we talk about ourselves – not the human proper.</div>
<br>		
<div>Considering all these examples, my negative apologia of anthropology's orientation vis-à-vis the videogame comes to this: none of these authors know what a videogame is and they are only interested in doing things with what a videogame is not  — and this is not to suggest I (yet) know what I videogame is, only that I want to do something with it. These authors are doing anthropology while doing a videogame or doing anthropology with the people who play videogames while taking the videogame ‘as given’. In this way, they generate an image of the human in or performing the videogame à la Lienhardt’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>:plate VI)</span> photo of the woman and child standing over to the left, and instead of spears and a shrine there is a videogame or the videogame is where they are standing; here is the human (maybe a new and under-represented type) and here is the thing (maybe a new and under-represented type) and here is an image of the two and we can see what they have to do with each other, and understand each one better, and we have given each one a voice – the voice we had in mind.</div>
<br>		
<div>And here are two problems: (1) the videogame is already an image without us giving anything to it at all and (2) the videogame, online social network or otherwise, is not an object or a place but an event. Ethnographies and anthropological engagements heretofore performed with the videogame in mind – and even outside any attempts at anthropological framing – prioritise the convenient application of familiar methodologies and theory over the fact that videogames entail a new human image event.</div>
