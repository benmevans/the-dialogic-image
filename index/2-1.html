<h2 align="center" id="2">2 DIALOGUE: THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE</h2>
	
	<h3>2-1 Videogames via the cinema</h3>
		
<div>It is easy to approach the videogame image via the cinema, at least as a first step. This is because thinking with videogames through concepts owed to cinema entails language and concepts that are familiar to us. Though Galloway’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Galloway 2006" target="_blank" title="Galloway AR (2006) Gaming: essays on algorithmic culture">2006</a>:2)</span> definition of videogames draws a clear distinction between the two mediums — ‘If photographs are images, and films are moving images, then video games are actions’ — he still relies on cinematographic language and gestures to explore what videogames are doing. For example, the first-person shooter is described as a POV shot, and Italian neorealism is evoked to urge videogames towards a social realism, focused on ‘narrative, not representation’ <span class="reference">(Galloway <a href="r.html#Galloway 2006" target="_blank" title="Galloway AR (2006) Gaming: essays on algorithmic culture">2006</a>:39,75,80)</span>. When Atkins <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Atkins 2003" target="_blank" title="Atkins B (2003) More than a game: the computer game as fictional form">2003</a>:24)</span> imagines some future day when ‘…perhaps, the computer game will even produce its À la Recherche du Temps Perdu or its Ulysses, its Casablanca or its Citizen Kane’, it is easy to see his point. When will the videogame produce, and (perhaps more importantly) be recognised for, the kind of penetrating reflections on life and the human condition commonly celebrated in the classics of literature and cinema? And this question assumes such classics will surely reveal themselves in time, for the videogame is assumed to be on a similar trajectory to other mediums born out of older technologies, most recently cinema.</div>
<br>
<div>And it is easy to regard many videogames as a kind of interactive film, especially when they are so often designed and presented in cinematic ways. Motion capture is now a stage of development many films and videogames share: the capturing and reproduction of movement for the sake of an image it has not yet become. Computer generated images are not an essential part of videogames or films, but both have embraced that style of image making. There is a clear difference in application. Videogames usually need the image of gameplay to be one continuous shot, so motion capture is reserved to those instances where videogames express what is unique about them the least: the cutscene. The exception to this is the interactive cutscene, like the dance battle in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> <span class="reference">(Nomura et al. <a href="r.html#Nomura 2020" target="_blank" title="Nomura T, Hamaguchi N and Toriyama M (directors) (2020) Final fantasy vii remake [videogame]">2020</a>)</span> or the torture scene in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> <span class="reference">(Druckmann et al. <a href="r.html#Druckmann 2020" target="_blank" title="Druckmann N, Newman A and Margenau K (directors) (2020) The last of us part ii [videogame]">2020</a>)</span>. These are pulling the functions of the original cutscene, where videogames resemble film, into the realm of interactivity. These instances, especially when they are taken outside the broader context of the videogames they are a part of, can feel and look like watching a film which demands occasional button presses to be sure we are paying attention. </div>
<br>		
<div>Interactive or otherwise, cutscenes have been a part of videogames since we started traversing 3D worlds, at least since <em>Super Mario 64</em> <span class="reference">(Miyamoto <a href="r.html#Miyamoto 1996" target="_blank" title="Miyamoto S (director) (1996) Super Mario 64 [videogame]">1996</a>)</span>. There we see the visuals of gameplay itself presenting a greater conceptual hurdle in the minds of developers and players than the game’s cutscenes. The opening cutscene (see <a href="#Figure 7" title="Figure 7: Super Mario 64" target="_blank">Figure 7</a>) attempts to provide a diegetic explanation for the new cinematic element of gameplay, namely an adjustable camera following the controllable character. It opens with a sweeping aerial shot of Peach’s castle, following one of the Lakitu Bros. — a turtle-like creature, floating on a cloud, holding a fishing rod with a camera attached to it. We see a pipe come out of the ground and the Lakitu Bro. circles around. It then cuts to a POV shot of the pipe from the Lakitu Bro.’s camera’s perspective, Mario jumps out of the pipe, and this is how we are introduced to the floating continuous shot following the controllable character in third-person videogames. When we move the camera around Mario, we are actually controlling one of the Lakitu Bros.</div>

	</figure>
<br>
<div>This was demonstrated to us in the first instance via the language of cinema, a language we already understood. What we see in <em>Super Mario 64</em> has become the standard transition from cutscene to gameplay. The over-the-shoulder-shot pulls us into the image, it hands us the reigns or, more accurately, poses to the viewer a question and by answering that question the viewer becomes a player. We have come to expect this kind of shot, this transition where cinema metamorphizes into a videogame. Its worth noting how <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> plays with that expectation in its opening cutscene. We are eager to take control, and the camera teases us by first settling behind Biggs and then Barret before finally orienting us in relation to the game’s protagonist, Cloud.</div>

<div>The cinema here, is moving on the videogame’s terms, it cannot escape asking the question and in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> we see a creative evolution of how it is being asked.</div>
