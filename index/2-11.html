	<h3>2-11 The dialogic image (b)</h3>

<div>This description of <em>Street Fighter</em> as dialogue frames videogames around the Bergsonian philosophy of the new. There are unprecedented game-states that the developers could not have anticipated — they can only create fences. Though the computer contains, in its programming, a finite list of our possible actions, it cannot predict what our next action will be. It can only take a catalogue of all previous actions; it can only become along with us. In videogames we participate in a new instance of movement, real novelty, because to play a videogame is to be more than a consumer, it is to participate in a mutual becoming, which works to produce the image.</div>
<br>
<div>Humans participate together to form a videogame image in a shared movement and this does not exclude the apparatus. One can have a dialogical encounter with a piece of nature or art or whenever we become with an object, where it ceases to be an object for us, and we slide together into an in-betweenness. This phenomenon, in the case of videogames, can be observed in a very literal sense. There is a shared dependency between the human and the apparatus to perform a mutual transformation. The thing that is evolving resides in neither party alone but is a literal coming together, a single movement like Bergson’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:285)</span> description of perception. When we play <em>Street Fighter</em> and are not pulling ourselves out of the act of play through deliberate objectification of the game or an opponent, the threshold separating subject and object disappears. This is the case even while playing alone against the computer. Our movements become the illusions of movement on the screen, but now they are real, for there is no definite threshold.</div>
<br>
<div>In multiplayer instances, a creative event shared between player, developers and hardware is what enters into relation with another human opponent to form another image, another possible framing of an irreducible event. In this instance it is even harder to decern or justify a dialogic centre and in one sense the event becomes more real or decisions have more interpersonal weight. Playing <em>Street Fighter</em> against another person is, for most people, always preferable. There is a realness to the movements, even while playing against a stranger online, that is absent against the computer or against what the game’s development team have anticipated. We could describe multiplayer as a dialogue between two players that is mediated by a machine and developers, like two dialogues entering into a third dialogue. But this suggests that there are multiple creative acts happening simultaneously, which is misleading. We can artificially distinguish separate elements, separate dialogic gestures, but the shared becoming itself should ultimately be regarded as a single human event – where parameters lose meaning.</div>
<br>
<div>This shared becoming between humans and machines is further complicated when we consider a temporally offset dialogue happening between players and game developers. With a computer, the developer lays out a finite plane predicting and responding to every possible action from the player, enabling and restricting, expanding and shrinking possible actions. To then play the game entails cutting a path through that finite plane, replacing the possible with the potential, the finite with the virtual. We are never playing a videogame by ourselves because there is a constant and indirect collaboration with the developers to create the emerging image-event. What makes this exchange irreducible and dialogic is that the path itself cannot be foreseen because of player and developer agency – except a temporal dissonance makes mutuality uneven. The contents of the plane prior to the game's development cannot be predicted, for developing a game is its own creative act. However, the game's gesture is incomplete until it is actioned by a player and when a player performs an action the developer's response has literally already taken place. Player and developer mutually depend on each other in shared production of the new.</div>
<br>
<div>This final dialogue between the developers and the players serves to show how many different elements are being brought into relation in the event of a <em>Street Fighter</em> match. We can artificially isolate separate dialogical instances of mutual becoming, one between the human and the apparatus, another between two humans in the moment of a match and another between the player and developer. These disparate participants should be regarded as converging elements that form a single creative and social event. While Goffman <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Goffman 1967" target="_blank" title="Goffman E (1967) Interaction ritual: essays on face-to-face behaviour">1963</a>:17)</span> extended the scope of social situations to encompass ‘physical copresence, tele-phonic connection or letter exchange’, there is both an immediacy and potentiality to videogames which makes them unique. The player enters into a becoming where agency is central, but there is also a kind of submission to larger pre-planned transformations. The emergence taking place is based on a mutual inheritance which has already partially happened and yet remains unresolved.</div>
<br>
<div>Notwithstanding the technical feat involved in the broad phenomenon that is <em>Street Fighter</em> and the extent to which it has been created in this respect, by virtue of the coalescence of multiple dialogic elements, it remains fundamentally a becoming that is facilitated by technology. Like Handelman’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Handelman 2005" target="_blank" title="Handelman D (2005) ‘Introduction: why ritual in Its own right? how so?’">2005</a>)</span> picture of ritual, <em>Street Fighter</em> and other videogames can be assigned their own autonomy and are thus independent happenings. This has a tendency of being masked when we are distracted by the spectacle of the apparatus itself in a quantitative pursuit of realism or violence.</div>
