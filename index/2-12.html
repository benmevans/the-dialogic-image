	<h3>2-12 The animated image</h3>
		
<div>I have used the word ‘animation’ above, along the way of describing the dialogic event which produces a videogame image with specific reference to <em>Street Fighter</em>. Animation can also be regarded as a separate medium, distinct from both cinema and videogames, but here I will regard it as a means or method which can be employed in cinema or videogames in the process of producing an image. Another method, is this regard, would be the camera or the gamepad, or unreal engine. Animation is a means of producing an image by generating frames. Videogame players work with developers and artists, in a small capacity in terms of labour but in a large capacity in terms of the decisive last instant which chooses the next frame, to produce an animated image.</div>
<br>		
<div>Animation is not an essential feature of videogames. The videogame event employs animation for what it can lend to the image. We can see this in the history of Japanese role-playing games like <em>Final Fantasy</em> <span class="reference">(Ito <a href="r.html#Ito 2000" target="_blank" title="Ito H (director) (2000) Final fantasy ix [videogame]">2000</a>; Kitase <a href="r.html#Kitase 1997" target="_blank" title="Kitase Y (director) (1997) Final fantasy vii [videogame]">1997</a>, <a href="r.html#Kitase 1999" target="_blank" title="Kitase Y (director) (1999) Final fantasy viii [videogame]">1999</a>, <a href="r.html#Kitase 2001" target="_blank" title="Kitase Y (director) (2001) Final fantasy x [videogame]">2001</a>; Kitase and Ito <a href="r.html#Kitase 1994" target="_blank" title="Kitase Y and Ito H (directors) (1994) Final fantasy vi [videogame]">1994</a>; Komoto <a href="r.html#Komoto 2010" target="_blank" title="Komoto N (disigner) (2010) Final fantasy xiv [videogame]">2010</a>; Sakaguchi <a href="r.html#Sakaguchi 1987" target="_blank" title="Sakaguchi H (director) (1987) Final fantasy [videogame]">1987</a>, <a href="r.html#Sakaguchi 1988" target="_blank" title="Sakaguchi H (director) (1988) Final fantasy ii [videogame]">1988</a>, <a href="r.html#Sakaguchi 1990" target="_blank" title="Sakaguchi H (director) (1990) Final fantasy iii [videogame]">1990</a>, <a href="r.html#Sakaguchi 1991" target="_blank" title="Sakaguchi H (director) (1991) Final fantasy iv [videogame]">1991</a>, <a href="r.html#Sakaguchi 1992" target="_blank" title="Sakaguchi H (director) (1992) Final fantasy v [videogame]">1992</a>; Tabata <a href="r.html#Tabata 2016" target="_blank" title="Tabata H (director) (2016) Final fantasy xv [videogame]">2016</a>; Takai <a href="Takai n.d." target="_blank" title="Takai H (director) (n.d.)

Here is a battle sequence from each major entry in the franchise, from 1987 to 2016:</div>

</figure>
<div>We can see the number and extent of animated elements increase as such opportunities present themselves through advancing technologies. Animation is inserted or applied to the specific instances of gameplay where it has something to contribute. If it is applied with excess, this can have an impact on game design and gameplay; it can effect the possibilities of unfolding dialogue. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is worth noting again here, for how it attempts to reconcile the recreation of nostalgic and familiar game elements in a way that also fulfils current AAA expectations pertaining to animation. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> behaves like a standard 3D action game until the ATB (active time battle) gauge is full. Then the action can be paused for players to strategically select more powerful attacks, items or spells. Only, the animations have not paused entirely, gameplay is effectively paused but the animations still move in very slow motion which creates the feeling of passing time, as we can see here:</div>

</figure>
<div>There is a refusal here to return to the static images of the franchise's early instalments and animation lends itself to the conveyance of an unfolding event, an event that has always been present even when full animations were impossible. The slowdown in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is the animation's acquiesces to larger gameplay agendas, a compromise between conflicting dialogue styles. The animation can lend itself to the videogame event, to conveying the image as an event, but it must just as frequently yield to gameplay. This submission has been described as a point of good game design. Animation is the crux where developers communicate a game's most important information, the possibilities of the unfolding image, to the player. This was described above in the case of <em>Street Fighter</em>; start-up frames are an intrinsic part of game design in fighting games. They are also an essential element of fighting game animation because they are necessary for communication, for the developer to communicate the possibilities of the image to the player, for the player to communicate and accommodate for their opponent's recognition of their intentions, the broadcasting of their choices within the image itself. Videogames have facilitated a particular animation style which fulfils the needs of dialogue. For example, in <em>Rayman 2</em> <span class="reference">(Ancel <a href="r.html#Ancel 1999" target="_blank" title="Ancel M (director) (1999) Rayman 2: the great escape [videogame]">1999</a>)</span> we can see traces of the feeling of gameplay in the animations of Rayman, the playable character. Rayman feels fast and snappy because the player can initiate the jump at any moment: from the middle of a role, from hanging on a ledge, the moment Rayman's feet touch the ground we can jump again. <em>Rayman 2</em> displays an animation style that accommodates for the spontaneity of dialogue, where the next frame, as a decision takes priority in the unfolding event. For, the image also belongs to the player and not just the sprite animator.</div>

<div>I first read Deleuze's <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>, <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>)</span> cinema books while I was learning how to play <em>Street Fighter V</em>. I took notes in the margins and underlined passages which seemed to conflict with, or reveal certain aspects of, the phenomenon of the fighting game I had immersed myself in. I can recall one, perhaps imagined case of Deleuze mentioning animation in that readthrough but have since been unable to locate it. ‘Animation’ does not appear in the index of <em>Cinema 1</em> or <em>Cinema 2</em>. I opened the PDF of each book – the object on my shelf has become an event on my monitor full of potentialities. I perform an OCR (optical character recognition) scan using <em>Adobe Acrobat Pro DC</em> <span class="reference">(Adobe <a href="r.html#Adobe 1993" target="_blank" title="Adobe (1993) Adobe acrobat [software]">1993</a>)</span> on the PDF document to convert it into searchable text, press Crtl + F, type ‘animation’ and press enter. Between the two books there is only one instance of that word occurring (though it is possible the OCR failed to recognise particular instances like, for example, if the word animation were spread across two lines with a hyphen). That single occurrence of ‘animation’ is in an endnote on page 230 in reference to Vertov <span class="reference">(citen in Deleuze <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:230)</span>. This is the bases of my conclusion that Deleuze has no interest in animation and my reading of the text with a mind preoccupied with frame data and character animations was not to extract a theory of animation that can be applied to the cinema; I was thinking about videogames via the cinema in a way that is similar to how this level commenced, leveraging the theoretical and conceptual maturity of ideas about an entirely different medium to stimulate original thought by challenging them in a new mode foreign to them.</div>
<br>
<div>Animation in and of itself is not problematic for Deleuze's <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>, <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>)</span> concepts of the cinema. We can take an animated film and easily identify within it whatever varieties of movement-image we can decern, ignoring the fact that these images have been accomplished through animation. What animation does for the cinema, takes place along a different line of thought. Brad Bird <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Bird 2018" target="_blank" title="Bird B (2018) 'Why Incredibles 2 director says cartoons aren't just for children' [video]">2018</a>)</span> was asked in an interview to comment on the recent Disney adaptations <span class="reference">(Branagh <a href="r.html#Branagh 2015" target="_blank" title="Branagh K (director) (2015) Cinderella [motion picture]">2015</a>; Favreau <a href="r.html#Favreau 2016" target="_blank" title="Favreau J (director) (2016) The jungle book [motion picture]">2016</a>, <a href="r.html#Favreau 2019" target="_blank" title="Favreau J (director) (2019) The lion king [motion picture]">2019</a>; Ritchie <a href="r.html#Ritchie 2019" target="_blank" title="Ritchie G (director) (2019) Aladdin [motion picture]">2019</a>)</span> of their classic animated films like <em>Cinderella</em> <span class="reference">(Geronimior et al. <a href="r.html#Geronimi 1950" target="_blank" title="Geronimi C, Luske H and Jackson W (directors) (1950) Cinderella [motion picture]">1950</a>)</span>, <em>The Jungle Book</em> <span class="reference">(Reitherman <a href="r.html#Reitherman 1967" target="_blank" title="Reitherman W (director) (1967) The jungle book [motion picture]">1967</a>)</span> <em>The Lion King</em> <span class="reference">(Allers and Minkoff <a href="r.html#Allers 1994" target="_blank" title="Allers R and Minkoff R (directors) (1994) The lion king [motion picture]">1994</a>)</span> or <em>Aladdin</em> <span class="reference">(Musker and Clements <a href="r.html#Musker 1992" target="_blank" title="Musker J and Clements R (directors) (1992) Aladdin [motion picture]">1992</a>)</span> into live action – What is being accomplished in this retreat from animation in pursuit of realism? Bird's response came to the defence of animation as ‘it’s own thing’ vis-à-vis images of movement captured through a camera. Photorealism, as provided by the camera, ‘…is not the reason to do animation anyway, the reason to do animation is caricature’. On these terms, animation is more than the reduction of an image into its essence, it is the enhancement of those faculties which make it distinct, specifically pertaining to movement. This caricature of movement can be implemented and lend itself to the cinema or the videogame but in each case, it is fulfilling a different need, contributing to a different event. Animation serves the cinema in reference to narrative and character, and though these are still relevant factors in how a game tells its story, animation in the videogame also must communicate to everyone involved in the event the possibilities and outcomes of the image as a dialogic event.</div>
