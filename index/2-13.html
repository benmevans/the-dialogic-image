	<h3>2-13 The dialogic image (c)</h3>
		
<div>One of my first naive goals for this project, in the early stages of its conceptualisation, was to describe real movement in <em>Street Fighter</em> à la the movement-image Deleuze <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>, <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>)</span> identified in cinema. The failure of this intention is what bore fruit, revealing how radically different the videogame is from the cinema. For it seemed that, according to Deleuze’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:24)</span> analysis of primitive cinema, <em>Street Fighter</em> ought to entail the cinematographic illusion par excellence. But <em>Street Fighter</em>, and videogames more generally, need to be regarded as an entirely separate phenomenon with a radically different essence so as to make this connection invalid. If we take player agency to be the fundamental gesture of interactive media (developers are players too), the image is immediately mobilised according to the same Bergsonian definitions of movement Deleuze employed, albeit in a completely different way.</div>
<br>	
<div>If videogames are regarded as events with their own evolving autonomy, we must acknowledge that they are unique and unprecedented in this regard. Their finite elements often include the generation and navigation of a spatial plane along a set of predetermined parameters, but in <em>Street Fighter</em> we have shown that these parameters can harbour infinite significance when their conception becomes the object of human striving and when they are integrated into the irreducible gestures of dialogue. The multifaceted nature of the event also makes it unique; videogames entail a creative evolution that is shared between disparate parties including the human, the non-human and the temporally displaced human. These coalesce in a single unpredictable moment that is its own autonomous event. Deleuze <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>:280)</span> regarded film-makers as philosophers, he did philosophy with the cinema, but videogames need to happen to anthropology. That is, they need to emerge for us as human events which take place within the process of producing an image. Videogames are presently interhuman and in them we can see the emerging human; a videogame is produced as an event, not an object.</div>
<br>		
<div>So far, this level has brought us to, and together we have come to, a certain understanding of the videogame. This understanding entails both a dialogic event and an image. We have discovered a binary. The image actualises in a way that is external to that dialogic event of its production; the image is a by-product. The only way to described those interhuman, complex social events on their own terms is to do so with the image as an external object to be produced. In a competitive <em>Street Fighter</em> match, I am trying to force the image to actualise in a certain way, and so is my opponent and so are/were all the developers. Our collective actions are pointed towards the resolution of this indeterminate object: the image. This took some work, the paradigm meets resistance, because software, as a general phenomenon, as a commodity, hides even the event of its production, framing itself <em>only</em> as an object which is consumed or ‘played’ in a non-complex and uni-directional manner. Let the dialogic event of image production, as it has been revealed above, now stand. It remains for us to understand the constituents of that separate image-object, the output of the dialogic image. It remains for us to discover <em>the transcendental image</em>.
