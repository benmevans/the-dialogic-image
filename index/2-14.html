	<h3>2-14 Computer graphics</h3>

<div>The rest of this level could be described as an exploration of computer graphics, isolated in themselves. In this way, we have not yet left this orientation where the image is something we consume. The transcendental image has been mentioned but not yet discovered for the sake of the big way of performing <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em>. So, we have graphics in mind and the image’s primary source is a device. The dialogic event so far developed needs to be bracketed to highlight our relationship with the device. Below we will see that regardless of how said device produces the image to be consumed (it could be rasterized or ray-traced) the event of these technologies constitutes an instance of the human body being captured in a complex relationship. Beyond users as consumers and devices as producers, the users’ role as producer <em>de jure</em>, and their merger with the device itself, will be revealed. This can be called our discovery of a more basic dialogue unfolding between the user and device. The upshot here will be the device (a monitor, television, smart phone, Gameboy Advance, Neo Geo Pocket, etc.), as a more active and complex component of the dialogic event this level has so far been describing and a further receding of the image-object. To honour what we have been developing and our burgeoning new understanding of the videogame, we will not regard the device to be the sole giver of digital images by not referring to the images in question as 'computer generated images'. The body and the screen and mere constituents of an image-event which will now be brought into focus.</div> 
<br>
<div>We have already seen that, ultimately, the device’s function in an image-event is not to simply give our perceptual organs an image to receive. The experience of the digital image cannot be separated from other, more fundamental elements of the event like user and developer intentionalities. This already means that the images we feel we ‘receive’ from our displays hold a special quality. Before we even <em>think</em> of them as images, they are distinct from the objects we say they represent. This is to say, they are specially perceived or set apart from other objects in the world <em>in the act of perception itself</em> prior to thought. This aligns with a more basic intuition; of course, we are never fooled by the image into thinking it otherwise, into thinking we are actually looking at the thing-that-the-image-is-of, and neither are our bodies. This is because viewing a digital image, the simple act of looking, presupposes a specific set of perceptual or bodily postures. These presuppositions can be summarised as the giving of one’s body over to the event. Put differently, the human experiences an embodied and dialogic relationship with the image, which is contextualised and dependent on a broader situation rooted in the physicality of the device and its meaning; i.e., I sit at my desk and turn on the computer, I put the VR headset over my eyes, I pull my phone out of my pocket and get into position, I orient the screen in relation to my body and go through these pre-perceptual manoeuvres to <em>allow my body to be captured</em>. Inasmuch as I am a consumer, I allow my body to be consumed in order to consume. The device’s function in the event is to capture our bodies and the image is not <em>in</em> the device; the device, in itself, does not produce the image because the actualisation of an image-object depends on <em>bodies</em>. In this new orientation, our bodies make the image.</div>
<br>
<div>The body is not captured by realism attributed to an already fully emerged and existing image. Neither does the device imitate styles from the natural world familiar to our sensory organs to give us the experience of an image. Rather, the body is captured via this aforementioned embodied performance with the device. I do not see a tree outside only to later discover it is a rasterized image. I might mistake a rasterized tree on my phone for a photo, but that is only my assigning the wrong imaging technology to a particular case; I always knew it to be an image of a tree on my phone. More than that, <em>my body performed and perceived it as an image on my phone, even before I knew it</em>. I marvel at the photorealism of the rasterized tree but photorealism’s goal and its achievement is not to fool our bodies. It is, rather, to play with them. To celebrate photorealism is to applaud an <em>event</em> and how parts of that event feel involuntary notwithstanding the intentionality of our body’s participation. There are two levels on which to explain this:
<ol> 
	<li>My conscious participation in the image-event (I searched ‘trees’ in Google Images<!-- reference -->) collides with my inability to articulate what is missing from the image, contextualisations notwithstanding, that would make it the perception of something that is not an image (the tree outside my window);</li>
	<li>My body’s participation in the image’s origins collides with the devices ability to stimulate lines and styles that reference and orient us towards the experience natural world (e.g. the shape of a tree), which objectify the natural world.</li> 
</ol>
Both these conflicts affirm the instrumentalisation of the body and lead to a feeling of it being played with.</div>
<br>
<div>Below we will see how videogame graphics can demonstrate this more effectively than Google Images<!-- reference --> because the videogame industry often values realism enabling technologies like ray-tracing beyond aesthetics and for the sake of user participation. Ray-tracing does not merely look good, it <em>feels</em> good to perform on/with the screen. The developer, player and device aspire to cast and trace some rays through a virtual world which is mutually dependent on all participants. I participate in this event with my body and unintentional, but welcome, things are happening to my body — or to perception — because I am not the only actor. This experience relies on my regarding said virtual world, pre-reflectively, in a particular way.</div> 
<br>
<div>And this is all to show that computer graphics are not an illusion, which is obvious, but derive value from (1) the way they demonstrate popular Cartesian philosophical stances pertaining to the instrumentalisation of the body and (2) the way they represent the stimulation of the body by an apparatus prior to thought. These will both require more elaborations, starting with what Merleau-Ponty (1945/2012:32) said concerning colour:</div> 
<blockquote class="small">The first perception of colors, properly so called, is thus a change in the structure of consciousness, the institution of a new dimension of experience, and the deployment of an a priori. </blockquote>
<div>And the same can said of pixels performing said colour in new ways, like ray-traced reflections in a puddle on the streets of Night City in <em>Cyber Punk 2077</em>:
