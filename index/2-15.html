	<h3>2-15 Abstracting and perceiving an image</h3>
		
<div>I am staring at a landscape on my monitor. There are mountains and trees, and a cloud is flouting through the sky in front of one of the mountains:</div>
<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/644189342?h=9193796d02&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="looking at a rasterized mountain"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
<figcaption class="small"><a href="#RFigure 19" target="_blank" title="Full citation for captured footage (new tab)">Figure 19</a>: Staring at a Rasterized Mountain</figcaption>
<div><em>After</em> seeing this image, I can think about how it is generated by a computer and can push to align my experience with that knowledge. That is, I can make an abstraction on top of the <em>a priori</em> given by perception, replacing the mountains, trees and clouds with an array of pixels changing colour. They change colour according to a process called rasterization, which works by starting with an object — like a mountain or a cloud — and placing that object on a grid that represents the computer monitor. Algorithms interject, for example, to alter the colours of the pixels according to which object is in front of another, like a cloud floating in front of a mountain.</div>
<br>
<div>While doing this can replace perceived images with pixels changing colour sixty times per-second, this experience is an application of knowledge which steps over the simpler and embodied initial episode; it is not a true return to the base of things. We can break the image up after the fact of perception on the device’s terms, with the device as our starting point, but this occludes the role of the body. Abstracting on the device’s terms, is a similar operation to the one performed earlier in this level with dialogue, in that it displaces the image-object to a new location where it still functions as something we consume; the image is what these complex objects and events are here for to give. In contrast our initial participation in the image-event, with our bodies and prior to conscious reflection, takes that experience as a whole in the first instance, and each successive frame is a new first instance. The consumed image is not something we assemble. The videogame image, like visual art, is seen before it is realised. This is unlike the image conceived as this document or a book or <em>a</em> videogame, i.e. a specific experience that must be read or played through, perhaps multiple times before we can orient ourselves in relation to its image or generate the whole image that is a work for ourselves (see Merleau-Ponty 1945/2012:223). To consume an image is to assume it is all already there, ready to be eaten and we eat it in order to see it.</div>

<div><em>Before</em> seeing the image things can be different: these brush strokes of Cézanne’s are white, blue, grey:</div>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/P9ZZMBp/Cezanne-sky.jpg" alt="Cezanne-sky" border="0" class="center"> 

<div>They could be of the sky or anything else and if I had more resolution I would zoom further into a single coloured three-dimensional glob of oil paint on the canvas - Cézanne’s painted pixel. The isolated pixel suggests nothing of the whole, nothing of the sky above <em>Mont Sainte-Victoire</em>:</div>
    <style>
 
        /* Set display to none for image*/
        #image {
            display: none;
        }
    </style>
</head>
 
<body>
    <div>
        <!-- Add id to image -->
        <img id="image" src="https://i.ibb.co/xhHrZrx/Paul-C-zanne-Montagne-Saint-victoire-Google-Art-Project.jpg" alt="Paul-C-zanne-Montagne-Saint-victoire-Google-Art-Project" border="0" class="center">
    </div>
 
    <button type="button"
        onclick="show()" id="btnID" class="center">
		We cannot unsee the whole. 
    </button>
 
    <script>
        function show() {
            document.getElementById('image')
                    .style.display = "block";
 
            document.getElementById('btnID')
                    .style.display = "none";
        }
    </script>

<div>There are no grey globs of paint in the final image, only the sky, mountain, fields, trees, etc. Once the image is complete or the painter has finished painting, we do not add up the strokes or count the pixels, just how ‘to see a face is not to form the idea of a certain law of constitution...’ (Merleau-Ponty 1945/2012:264) — we simply look at it.</div>
<br>
<div>We gesture towards it with our eyes and our bodies while the image makes its own ‘first attack upon [our] senses’ (Merleau-Ponty 1945/2012:249) in a shared event. We act on the image and the image acts on us; we enter a mutual unfolding. We could say we become the image, display, apparatus, code, pixels, any element of the image event, that these elements become something through us or we through them:</div>

<blockquote class="small">The thing and the world are given with the parts of my body, not through a “natural geometry,” but in a living connection comparable, or rather identical, to the living connection that exists among the parts of my body itself. (Merleau-Ponty 1945/2012:211)</blockquote>

<div>For an image to be consumed, in the moment of perception it is not a separate object to look at. We do not think or assemble or deduce an image, we give ourselves, our bodies, to this new event or performance that is synonymous with its own discovery:</div>
<blockquote class="small">Myself as the one contemplating the blue of the sky is not an acosmic subject standing before it, I do not possess it in thought, I do not lay out in front of it an idea of blue that would give me its secret. Rather, I abandon myself to it, I plunge into this mystery, and it 'thinks itself in me.' I am this sky that gathers together, composes itself, and begins to exist for itself, my consciousness is saturated by this unlimited blue. (Merleau-Ponty 1945/2012:222)</blockquote>

<div>To see Cézanne’s brush strokes again entails a removal of oneself from the whole and this removal is an <em>additional</em> reorientation away from that perceptual experience, an abstraction after the event of seeing. Likewise, on my computer screen, I cannot escape the final product and unsee the mountain at base; I can only add additional predicates to this new first experience. In this sense, the image has a certain hold on me and the event of seeing the image has changed me forever.</div>
