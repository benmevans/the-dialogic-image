<h3>2-18 How to dodge arrows in <em>Spelunky 2</em></h3>

<div>The videogame image, as transcendental image, as novel perceptual event, precedes contextualisations in memory or conjecture (be it in relation to narrative elements or gameplay mechanics). These contextualisations are external to the phenomena and are not formed on what I call the transcendental image’s terms. While the image event can stimulate our recollection of broader circumstances and we can deliberately bring those circumstances to bear on our thoughtful and intentional participation in the performance of an image, this recall removes a part of ourselves from the image-event, or at least, in such instances our contribution to the event has fundamentally changed because the image has become more of an object for us, namely an object to comprehend or manipulate. The more we play a videogame and align ourselves with and contribute to the event it is predisposed towards, as an unfinished event, the less we abstract the image into an object and the more we unconsciously accept the image’s a priori status, the less we think as bodies in a chair and the more we think as an image or in the style the image-event needs us think to fulfil our contribution, when we think at all — often the event does not parent a thought.</div>
<br>
<div>This is why we can rarely recall specific runs in <em>Spelunky 2</em>, especially after playing for a while. Performing that type of image effectively involves leaning into the event. That is, giving more of our pre-reflective bodily sates to it. Decisions are made on impulse to fulfil how the videogame image is wont to become. The event that is our person is becoming the image event. For example, dodging arrows in <em>Spelunky 2</em> is not a measured or calculated procedure but a spontaneous, evolving and creative emergence. The arrow dodge is not seen, calculated, memorised or  constructed — it happens:</div> 
<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/648431798?h=2750e050fc&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Dodging Arrow Traps.mov"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
<br>
<div>And here I am referring to the orientation necessary to perform the arrow dodge in the moment, not how we think about it before or after the fact, not modes which separate the human from the emergence we will later designate to be an arrow dodge. I am referring to the mode in which it is true that, in a very important sense, we can <em>feel</em> the arrow move passed and miss the playable character, which is how we get a feel for the arrows and learn how to dodge them. Like Merleau-Ponty’s<!--reference--> description of a cane, the arrow’s speed is something you experiment with and get a feel for via the performance of it, as an extension of our bodies:</div> 
<blockquote class="small">If I want to become habituated to a cane, I try it out, I touch some objects and, after some time, I have it ‘in hand’: I see which objects are ‘within reach’ or out of reach of my cane. This has nothing to do with a quick estimate or a comparison between the objective length of the cane and the objective distance of the goal to be reached. Places in space are not defined as objective positions in relation to the objective position of our body, but rather they inscribe around us the variable reach of our intentions and our gestures. To habituate oneself to a hat, an automobile, or a cane is to take up residence in them, or inversely, to make them participate within the voluminosity of one’s own body. Habit expresses the power we have of dilating our being in the world, or of altering our existence through incorporating new instruments. (Merleau-Ponty 1945/2012:144-145)</blockquote>
<br>
<div>Our flow state with an image is possible, because the image is <em>not</em> the product of some rationalism. An event happening to a device and we, as bodies, can become with that event and we could call this event an ‘image’. In this sense, it is not a virtual event but an event in the perceived world. We perceive the arrow in <em>Spelunky 2</em> by performing it with our bodies and incorporating the playable character into the ‘voluminosity’ of our bodies.</div> 
<br>
<div>There are other moments where thought and conscious reflection <em>do</em> occur within the image itself, like we saw above, when I threw a dog at the arrow trap to set it off.</div> 
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/d2xfZSh/dog-at-arrow.png" alt="dog-at-arrow" border="0" class="center">

<div>But we might just as well describe this as the <em>image</em> thinking for the lack of stages taken to arrive at the decision. I did not say to myself, ‘I want the image on this monitor to resemble a cartoon dog getting impaled by an arrow, so I will push these keys on my keyboard in this particular way, etc.’ My thought process was on the image’s terms, within the world of the image, direct to the ‘fiction’ being performed: ‘I see there’s a trap there — too risky to dodge or whip it — I’ll just throw the dog — it’ll probably survive’. And here I am yet to perform an abstraction, I think with the image as if it were infinite and it <em>is</em> infinite via the participation of my body inasmuch as my body is an infinite object (I will return to this notion of the body as an infinite object below). Thinking about what keys I will press involves a detachment prior to or after the image event has occurred to consider separate elements, and the event of pressing the keys is not our concern here. That event treats the image as an object and presupposes the image event we have been describing.</div>
