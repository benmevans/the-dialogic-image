	<h3>2-20 The image as a special perception</h3>
		
<div>We can regard all images as transcendental in this way (not only digital images or the videogame image though they do constitute a special case hence <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em>) because Merleau-Ponty’s concepts apply to the entire experience of perception. But we cannot let this lead us to regard images as equivocal to any other phenomena encountered in the natural world; we need to make things more complicated and preserve what makes images so special before further establishing what makes the videogame image special. In this section we will spend some words to regard the image in more general terms. We are inclined to regard visual images like photographs, paintings, films and videogames in the same way we regard other phenomena perceived in the natural world. To proceed further this inclination will need to be undone via a description of the image, non-specific to any medium, highlighting those aspects of images which sets them apart. That is, I will explain how images generate a body-subject while concealing other processes of the event.</div>
<br>		
<div>The image constitutes a distinct perceptual event, which points back to the process of perception and, in this way, it points back to our bodies as perceiving subjects. In [[2.17 Abstracting and perceiving an image]] I used Merleau-Ponty’s (1945/2012:222) description of perceiving the sky and likened it to the experience of perceiving Cézanne’s painting or a rasterized mountain from <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>, but Merleau-Ponty was not describing the experience of perceiving an image, and while it sufficed for the above example, there remains a distinction to be drawn. An image of a mountain constitutes a different human event to the beholding of a real mountain because the image reaches back at us, expressing human agency, a human otherness. </div>
	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/qMsmtJ6/shutterstock-598924397.jpg" alt="shutterstock-598924397" class="center" border="0">
<div>A real mountain in the distance is a part of the world the same way my body is a part of the world and there is a mutuality to our existence and the mountain communicates an <em>indifference</em> towards me. I am not the subject of the a far off mountain, distorting earth’s curvature, blocking the horizon — I can feel it do these things, I can become it being this way, but it is just as much without me. </div>
<br>
<div>The image, in contrast, is there <em>for me</em> and it wants to place me at the centre of perception and my body becomes the centre of a new world. The image generates a perceiving subject by virtue of its authorship. This is why Flusser (1983/2000:8) saw in the image, ‘a synthesis of two intentions: one manifested in the image and the other belonging to the observer’. The image carries its own intentionality; someone put it there. The viewer or user becomes the witness of something, they are the centre and the object of some process. The image was made to be seen and in as much as I reach out towards the image, the image reaches back and communicates something about me as a body and the fact that I behold and image.</div> 

<blockquote class="small">The Shu monk carried his green brocade lute<br>
down from the Omei peak in the West<br>
<br>
and strummed, for my pleasure alone, a tune<br>
like wind in a thousand pines.<br>
<br>
Flowing notes that wash the traveller’s heart<br>
linger as the sound of bells on frosty nights.<br>
<br>
I didn’t notice the green mountain growing dark<br>
or the many-layered clouds of autumn.</blockquote>

<div>We are left with a profound image of ‘the green mountain growing dark’ but, in truth, we did not encounter the image in the natural world, it emerged from the act of reading something that was <em>given</em> by Li Pai, and Gary Geddes and George Liang who translated it, and Ben Evans who put it in the document. We are describing a feature all images share, though in this quality of authorship is often taken for granted. The exception is the videogame, for it is both a whole, immediately perceived, and yet unfinished, a process that is waiting for us to make happen. But the general point about images is important for our understanding of the significance of this, what videogames are doing. The image pressurises an observer but we could also say it creates one. The event that is my life coalesces into a finite point and I become one thing, the object of the processes of this thing I do not see. For, when I look at an image I do not see an object or the event of image production — maybe it is a piece of paper with ink on it, or light projected on a wall or shifting liquid crystals — I see a miniature world and fall into a new event with my whole body.</div>
<br>
<div>It is a mistake to regard any image as objective, this includes photographs and technical images generally, and to regard an image as objective is to ignore the process of its emergence (Flusser 1983/2000:15). Images arrest and impose upon us a particular perspective, notwithstanding different interpretations. These differing interpretations all express the same fundamental orientation towards the image, they presuppose the stance of an interpreter. All interpretations of an image share the spatial alignment necessary to view the thing as an image. Merleau-Ponty’s (1945/2012:226) assertion that all perception is spatial is relevant here. The spatiality we experience in images is only possible as a bodily gesture, for ‘...there would be for me no such thing as space if I did not have a body’ (Merleau-Ponty 1945/2012:104). The image literally puts our bodies in a physical place. We see that space transform across mediums as they each introduce a different ‘modality of this [the body’s] anchorage’ (Merleau-Ponty 1945/2012:296), from the painting to the camera with its new forms of resemblance, to the cinema (as we have seen in Deleuze’s movement image) to the videogame image where we enter a new space, uniquely unfolded into a more totalising encompassment of our bodies, of a world, via dialogic interhuman situations, questions awaiting us within the image, i.e. interactivity. The videogame is a new night: ‘The night is not an object in front of me; rather, it envelops me, it penetrates me...  it is from within nocturnal space that I unite with it’ (Merleau-Ponty 1945/2012:296). Thus with each new medium we are dealing with radically new bodily situations and new worlds — for ‘we are our world’ and 'my body is the pivot of the world' (Merleau-Ponty 1945/2012:84, 109). Thus, the image entails a very specific, embodied and subjective experience, which could be described as a new world.</div>
<br>
<div>So when new image technologies emerge these signify new perceptual situations, new body states, gestures and habits for us to become used to. This is why our initial reactions to new imaging technologies never last. We become practised at getting our grip on the situations until they are seamlessly incorporated into the playspace of our being-in-the-world. Dauthendey describes this in relation to people’s first encounters with photographs:</div> 
<blockquote class="small">In the early days, people did not dare to look for very long at the first pictures [Daguerre] produced. They were startled by the vividness of the figures and believed that the tiny little faces of the personages who appeared on the image could see them too. That is how uncanny an effect the unaccustomed vividness and lifelikeness of the first daguerreotype images exerted on everyone. (Dauthendey cited in Benjamin 1931/2015:69)</blockquote>
<br>
<div>The novelty of images as new orientations for our bodies is also a source of great appeal. We see this in the videogame industry’s preoccupation with graphical photorealism and how arresting the application of new technologies can be for us. What now seems like an exaggerated hyperbole, was Kasavin (1997:para.2) expressing his genuine experience of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> in his 1997 review:</div>
<blockquote class="small">This is the most dazzling visual experience to date on any console. Film-quality computer-generated cinematics blend seamlessly with pre-rendered background artwork to create the strikingly realistic world of Final Fantasy VII, both beautiful in its grandeur and terrifying in its detail.</blockquote>

 <div>Our experience with images can change radically over time, not because some new element of the image is discovered, but because our position in relation to images generally, the habits of our bodies, is constantly changing. In this way, we do not encounter images the same way we encounter other objects in the natural world. An image event occurs when we dilate our being, our body, our capacity for there to be a world, into a single point. We apply that capacity onto a canvas, which is what gives images spatiality. Our world and spatiality are given to the image-event and, in this sense, rather than being a thing in the natural world, we can regard the image to be our body’s performance of a second-order world. By becoming with that world, we are changed by the image event forever.</div>
