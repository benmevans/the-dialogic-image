	<h3>2-22 The Value of Non-Realism</h3>
	
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/18xyRJR/kena-mountain.png" alt="kena-mountain" class="center" border="0">	
<div>There are features of the image, which contribute to this appeal that do not nessisarily run along the lines of realism. For example,^[I could come up with a different example of this for this section.] the strangeness of said mountain: the sharp lines and odd lighting which make it distinct from a photograph of a mountain, as well as the flatness, smallness and lack of bodily presence. The lack of bodily presence is also there in the photograph or the cinema, anywhere where the image is contained in a rectangle, where it is clearly nested or anchored in the natural world. VR is a responce to this graounding that will be explored later. But there are other elements, unique to the rasterized image that make it stranger than the photograph. Videogames resort to rasterization became the image needs to be generated in real time; the image isn't just happening to me, I am also happening to the image in the event of gameplay.</div>
		
<div>These features or flaws don't deduct for the image's value but help me identify the type of image I see. They help me understand what the apparartis is, because I can understand what it is doing to my body, how I am being oriented. I use this to understand the experience and its value. Dwelling on the particularities of a rasterized image only describes the type of experience we are having and does nothing to weaken the hold the image has on us.</div>
		
<div>There is a dual nature to the episode that the whole body is geared towards.  An infinite object, namely the self – the feeling of possession of one’s body – is given to a finite plane. What manifests itself as a strangeness upon reflection (e.g. broken textures, lighting or artefacts) is performed as a situation of empowerment connected to our comprehension of the limits of the image. The feeling of domination is tied to a gesture of submission.</div>

<div>To celebrate graphical fidelity is to applaud the spectacle of our bodies being played with. The image is part of a second-order world dependent on this more fundamental fact. I say it is a second order world because, as was stated in section 2.15, no image, be it a description in a book, photo, film or videogame gives us the equivelent of a real mountain in the first instance as what is initially percieved which we abstract afterwards to dispel illusion. Knowing the image is not ‘real’ does nothing to overcome the possession of one’s body in relation to it; the realness of the image is not what captures us. We value the image for the way it is not real and the dominating stance this enables us to assume in relation to it, this domination happens because the image was not the real thing in the first instance.</div>

 <img src="https://i.ibb.co/mHRvWC7/witcher-mountain.png" alt="witcher-mountain" class="center" border="0">
 
<div>The image is a broken mountain that can be undone with the pulling of a thread, leaning in and breaking it further, but the next instance always provides a new broken mountain. Standing before mount Everest, the gravity and presence of its mass envelops one’s entire body. Leaning into the experience consumes the body further still and one becomes lost, or as Merleau-Ponty might say, one ‘falls into’ the mountain. This does not describe our relationship with devices, I do not fall into the mountain on my computer screen, I fall into the monitor but the image of the mountain stimulates my body in such a way that it holds me, my body, at a distance – I marvel at what it is doing to me. There are habbits of my perception that recognise elements of the real thing, but what is a preori, that which has be presupposed to view the image in the first place, will always anchore the experience as the experience of an image. Were it not so, the experience would have not value, and I will have truly found myselve in one of Descartes nightmares, though I may never discover the truth of my situation. In the videogame image I know my situation and this is what contributes to it feeling so good.</div>
