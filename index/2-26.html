	<h3>2-27 The CRT</h3>
		
<div>For an example of this tendency of technological development, I will consider the CRT (cathode ray tube) monitor sitting on my desk. The CRT works by firing electrons from a cathode at the back of the monitor to the glass at the front. These types of monitors are old, heavy and take up a lot of desk space because they have to be deep – the electrons have to travel a distance to create the image. They were expensive to make and are difficult and potentially dangerous to dispose of. For the same reason it is not worth trying to repair one unless you are a professional. I found my CRT, a ViewSonic E70, dumped on the side of the road covered in mud. After bringing it home and seeing that it still worked, I put it on the desk in my office, right next to my 4k 28inch Samsung LCD. I found that there is something fundamentally different in the experience of using a CRT, opposed to an LCD, which extends beyond pure image quality.</div>
		
<div>And I should note that there are many passionate online communities who prefer CRTs and express their preference on the grounds of image quality alone. There is a higher perceived dynamic range; colours are richer and can be more accurate than an LCD; because there is no set number of pixels, they can scale to a larger variety resolutions and do so natively; images are softer, but this also means lower resolutions look better; from my experience, lower frame-rates appear smother, which seems to be because the monitor has both vertical and horizontal refresh rates – a single electron beam moves across and down the screen to create the image. Of course, nostalgia plays a role in CRT’s appeal today too, especially for playing retro PC games.</div>
		
<div>But there is also something more fundamental in the experience of using a CRT that is to do with the body’s relationship with the device and, as such, the event of the image being generated. The image is grounded in a weighted physicality, there is depth to it, not by virtue of colour depth for that only relates to the techniques of generating the image, but by virtue of the depth of the machine itself.  ‘It looks like you’re looking through a lens, like a piece of glass instead of a digital display’ (Linneman <a href="r.html#Linneman 2019" target="_blank" title="Linneman J (December 7 2019) ‘DF direct: CRT displays - was LCD a big mistake for gaming?’ [video]">2019</a>:<a href="https://youtu.be/tvRyVZWuvQ4?t=328" target="_blank" title="Linneman J (December 7 2019) ‘DF direct: CRT displays - was LCD a big mistake for gaming?’ [video]">5’28”</a>) and more than that, in a way that feels like you are looking into another world.  The rounded glass at the front of the device is looked through into a beyond that has physical presence and which is unknown, lending mystery to the image. The size and weight of the monitor manifests itself in one’s immediate perception of the image being produced; the electrons fired from the cathode pass through a physical hidden cavity, which my body enters into a relation with, and is part of the initial framing of the image, prior to thought. What is nihilism in the flat Samsung panel, seeking to conceal all its inner workings in order to give our bodies an isolated image, becomes mystery that has meaning in the CRT– not necessarily for thought after the event of perception but before that, for the body and its relation to the world. But here I am working against the direction of technological development, which is to remove such meaning from the body, to decontextualize perception, because this leads to greater stimulation. Of course, the CRT is stimulating too, but on very different grounds, especially when it is sitting next to another monitor that is only a couple of years old.</div>
		
<div>What is terrifying in the LCD is also exhilarating and this is tied to a belief in the second-order world which demonstrates the conquering of our bodies. Perception ceases to be a mystery amidst our faith in the isolated image. This image presents itself as existing independently of the world in which our bodies and perceptions are rooted. In contrast, the CRT’s image has a direct spaciality associated with it. The way the former seeks to undermine the body, prior to thought, demonstrates a kind of control that is quintessentially Cartesian. We are held by the image while marvelling at how such an instrumentation of our own bodies gives the illusion of control. In this way, we also practice refusing a part of ourselves, indeed, such a refusal constitutes our complex relationship with the image. We keep a portion back in order to marvel at what is taking place, to behold what is happening, seemingly involuntarily, to our bodies and to celebrate the accomplishment of technology this demonstrates.</div>
