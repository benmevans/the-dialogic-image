	<h3>2-30 Videogames via the Image</h3>
	
<div>In the same way my CRT monitor above was able to highlight how one’s experience with a computer-generated image is the upspring of a more fundamental embodiment, videogames reveal how those same devices reappropriate the primordial faith that is fundamental to the experience of being and having a body. All software gives the user a second-order world where they can experience embodied intentionality in a strange and conflicting context, which reaffirms a Cartesian dualism that is fundamental to the modern sense of self. (In Sources of the Self, Taylor (<a href="r.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>) connects Cartesianism to modern selfhood, and in a previous essay I painted software as the supreme expression of the same). Videogames are instances of software that should be disturbing to us, because of their ambition to enact the fulfilment of a second-order world in such a literal way. For, there is no other way to describe their ambition. The sheer mass of recent open-world games is an obvious gesture to make my son’s naive presumptions a reality – to insert infinity into a finite plane through brute force computing power. This ambition is only made possible by ignoring the body, the only real infinite object at our disposal, which ironically is the foundation of the image itself as we have already shown. This is present throughout all software, but videogames are the forefront of bodily stimulation and capture because much of their appeal is in how they provide an alternate world for the body to perform. The body gets to pretend to ignore itself and the user experiences an empowering self-awareness and self-affirmation in this apparent conquering of their bodies. Videogames make the rasterized image of the mountain (explored in my beginning phenomenological treatment of the rasterized image) a field of possible action and the trend of videogames has been to increase the size of that field, to fulfil the bodies basic expectations towards infinity.</div>

<div>But even if effective infinity is achieved in the realm of possible action, as we see in games with continuous randomly generating worlds, finitude persists in other more basic elements of the experience which enable the self-affirming sever just described. While rasterization currently fulfils what I am describing here – it is true that the rasterized image does appear broken and we do immediately perceive it as such – it seems that ray tracing will eventually overcome this as graphics continue to approach photorealism. The famous Cornell Box experiment is an example of this, where researchers placed boxes in a controlled environment, took a picture, then simulated the same conditions with ray tracing to create two almost indistinguishable images. If it were possible to make a game with photographs, or a game that was indistinguishable from a video recording, this would do nothing to undermine what is fundamentally finite in the phenomenon. The only thing that has changed is the means by which the image is generated.  While this context can provide a great deal of meaning to the user, that significance is as much tied to the bodies ability to rupture whatever plane it is pointed towards into infinity, as it is to the limited nature of the image which gives it value and significance. The image still transpires within a device and the bodies relationship with the same will always be more basic. That we can tolerate our perception immediately being seized by the image is only possible because the rasterized or ray traced image is not a whole infinite phenomenon.</div> 

<div>The inexhaustibility we associate with our experiences in videogames or any other media, is the irreducibility of our own bodies and the bodies of other humans which constitute the event taking place. The spectacle is to feign detachment from our bodies and an infinite plane transpires in the dialectic between these two irreconcilable premises, namely between our bodies which are the conditions of there being anything at all and software as a contained event within an apparatus, concealed but nevertheless demonstrably finite. Computer graphics are not captivating because we are approaching the base of things in their accomplishment, they are captivating because they create the feeling of moving away from it. They are a false attempt to violate the body, and their value is dependent on that falsehood, on the failure of the enterprise, and the bodies ability to find the infinite wherever we point it.</div>

<div>I said earlier that the body, as an infinite object, is surrendered over to the apparatus as a finite object. We are now in a position to expand on what this entails and how it is only true according to a certain construal of infinity. The digital world is participated in and becomes real for us according to, to borrow Mimica’s phrase, a particular ‘intimation of infinity’. We could describe my son’s failure to appreciate the limitations of the digital world of Mega Man X2 as a failure to comprehend the type of infinity achieved in the apparatus. The numbers we experience in the various quantities associated with the experience of the images on the screen are connected to a particular understanding of infinity, which is a learned way of regarding our bodies. It is not a wholistic infinity but one that is continuous successive states which never find an end state. To use a computer and participate in the generated image on the screen is to learn to regard one’s body in this limited way. We know from the anthropological data Mimica presents that this is not the only way to intimate infinity, as we see in the Iqwaye, for example. So, it is not a question of following a course which resembles our base, embodied, experience, as we have already established via a phenomenological treatment. It is a learned orientation that we come to be able to approximate in relation to the device. This, in turn, entails a way of regarding our bodies as computational devices with a series of assemblages we call ‘sense organs’, which can be ‘tricked’ into seeing digital objects that are not really there. But we have seen above that this is not the case. Children see the digital image, and for them it is a real object, not because they have been fooled by the machine, children see a world of possible action they can orientate their bodies towards just like adults. Their naivety is rooted in an unfamiliarity with the particular kind of infinity we limit our bodies to.</div>

<div>Children do not appreciate the ray traced image on the grounds of realism, from films to hand drawn animation, all is equally real for it all holds the same potential to seize their bodies. I can demonstrate this with another conversation I had with my son, just last night when I was reading Winnie-the-Pooh to him. My son, Benjamin, who just turned four, asked,</div>
<div class="benjamin">Dad, where is Winnie-the-Pooh?</div> 
<div>I told him that I thought Winnie-the-Pooh was in a museum somewhere. (Here I am referring to the actual soft toy on which the stories were based). He then asked,</div>
<div class="benjamin">Does he walk around in the museum?</div>
<div class="me">No, he’s a teddy bear just like yours. And just like you make up stories with your toys, Christopher Robin’s dad made up stories about Winnie-the-Pooh and wrote them down in this book.</div>
<div class="benjamin">But I’ve seen Winnie-the-Pooh moving and walking around on the TV.</div>
<div class="me">That was an animation.</div>
<div class="benjamin">What’s an animation?</div>
<div class="me">An animation is when you get lots of pictures like this,</div> 
<div class="me">and put them together to make them move.</div>
<div class="benjamin">Is the Wiggles an animation?</div>
<div class="me">No, the Wiggles are real people like you and me, but they make the pictures of them move in a similar way, using a camera.</div>

<div>For Benjamin, the Wiggles were just as ‘real’ as a Winnie-the-Pooh cartoon because he has not learned to celebrate degrees of resemblance and the pursuit of photo realism. Indeed, the question of reality was not a question for him until I taught him about a new style of reality which excludes Winnie-the-Pooh, but somehow, very strangely, includes the Wiggles even though the reality of their movement-image rests on the same grounds as Winnie-the-Pooh’s. This is to orientate him towards resemblance as a value and yardstick for technological achievement and bodily stimulation. And this is something computer generated images especially will gradually teach him to gear his body towards, because of the direction of its development. The way ray tracing looks better than rasterization must be interpreted, one must be taught why the former ‘looks better’. Images are coming to look more ‘real’ according to a certain standard. And this should not surprise us at all, especially in regard to computer graphics because a mathematics of association is what makes the devices and images possible in the first place, the trajectory of the devices development is directly tied to it and the reinforced expectations we continue to have around the stimulation of our bodies.</div>  

 <div>From here we can associate computer graphics with Russel’s definition of number as rooted in one-one correspondence. This is the theory of number that was assumed by Piaget in his treatment on the origins of number in children critiqued by Mimica. The above paragraph on children’s comprehension of the digital image lends itself to Mimica’s arguments because it shows that the kind of infinity assumed in the appreciation of the digital image to be learned and enculturated over time. One-one correspondence does not resemble the base of things, which computers have been able to harness and continue to approach through gradual improvements in the resemblance of the image to real life. We value ray tracing and photorealism through the premise of Russel’s theory of number, thought it is not solely Russel’s.</div>  

<div>This is also an assumption born from scientific convenience in that it is an infinity we can act and make progress on. There is always a further enhancement of the image to instigate and computing is based on the premise that everything is countable, including infinity in the fulness of time, and everything is either true or false. There is always another false, a failure pertaining to the question for photorealism. There is always another inaccuracy to make true, and the Cornell box demonstrates nothing because it is a closed and controlled environment, and the likeness is in regards to the photo while the experience of the room is a non-issue, for it harbours a different kind of infinity that cannot be approached in any way.</div>

<div>The room that is not a photo but the experience of one’s body as an infinite object is never approach in the Cornell Box experiment or in any instance of ray tracing or rasterization.  The body, as the precondition for there being anything at all is holistically infinite in how it extends an inexhaustible field. It is not something that never runs out, like the consecutive ones and zeros of a computer, but infinite in the sense that the field is everything that there is. There is nothing to add to it, no false inaccuracies to later be made true. Removing a sensory organ subtracts nothing from it because it is existence itself, our being in the world. It is the field in which we orientate ourselves towards an object.</div> 

<div>We orientate ourselves around our devices to adopt a stance that will allow us to come to terms with them, discovering their meaning for us as participants in a world shared with other humans. The image engages our bodies by stimulating the habitual paths of our sensory organs and offering a limited field of potential action. We give our bodies to the phenomenon, exercise a belief and expectation in regard to a second-order world, and thereby imbue the image with infinity. Not the limited infinity found in the device itself, but that which is inexhaustible in us as bodies inhabiting a space that encompasses everything in existence. This is how our experience with a computer-generated image can be described as beholding our bodies, though we do not always realise that is what we are doing. I am not looking at a rasterized mountain, I am looking at myself, or my body, as it is stimulated, and this is the orientation with the device that harbours the most meaning and potential action for me. So, my gaze is diverted away from the thing itself and towards the faculties within that can find an inexhaustible field wherever they are pointed and marvelling at the fact. For things on the computer to be infinite in the sense that is basic to lived experience, to achieve the miracle I referred to earlier, the image must refer back to our bodies, the body must be reintroduced, unbeknownst to ourselves, for a second time and we must be reminded of something that refers to our being in the world more broadly. The image transcends the parameters of the machine, it can do this, notwithstanding the limitations of the apparatus and the means by which the image has come into existence by referring to something infinite and that is, by appealing to the body in a more fundamental way. This cycle, just described ought to baffle us, for it demonstrates the habit our bodies have of finding infinity wherever they are pointed, even when they are pointed at a machine designed to capture them and a philosophical stance that does not seem to believe in it.</div>  

<div>I will now close with a very brief example of what I have just described. It has to be an example of a digital image that does not depend on narrative context to be recognisable, for narrative is not where we are trying to locate infinity. It also needs to exemplify outdated graphics so as to avoid the tendency to base its value on some kind of resemblance to reality or quantities of detail. But we should also be careful to avoid a aesthetic analyses or appreciation of the image, for that is not immediately given. On these grounds, this final example could be almost any outdated rasterized image. But considering the contributions my son has made to this essay and the ideas presented in it, it seems only proper to end with the character design from Mega Man X. For, even with this simple organisation of pixels, deprived of the value current ideologies of graphical realism might place on it, we are able to recognise our bodies immediately grasp for and construct an inexhaustible field around it. This is all possible through the way the image is able to inspire in us a reference back to our bodies and embodied experience, or to the conditions that have given us the image in the first place.</div>
