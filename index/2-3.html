	<h3>2-3 The Movement-Image</h3>

<div>According to Deleuze <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>, <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>)</span>, cinema gives us real movement. That is, from the illusion of movement created by a series of still frames presented rapidly and at equal distance from each other, movement is ‘extracted from itself’ <span class="reference">(Deleuze <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:24)</span>. From the illusion, cinema extracts ‘real movement’, not by adding movement to a still image, imitating natural perception, but via the mobilisation of a set. This mobilisation is accomplished through the movement of the camera and through cinematographic techniques like montage <span class="reference">(Deleuze <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:25)</span>. The set of frames that originally formed a cinematographic illusion, are mobilised through a breach of the limitations of the subject. The camera moves freely and instantly through space and time and in this way generates real movement.</div>
<br>	
<div>But it will not become clear exactly why or how this transcendence of subject and object constitutes real movement until the Bergsonian picture of movement Deleuze <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>)</span> had in mind is clarified. Real movement, for Bergson <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>)</span>, is infinite in two complementary ways which nullify the movement from, and the distinction between, a subject and object.</div>
<br>		
<div>Real movement is absolutely indivisible <span class="reference">(Bergson <a href="r.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:246-253, <a href="r.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>:194-200)</span>. When measuring a trajectory, we consider the changes in distance between two or more objects over time. The line imagined between the objects, which is divided into sections and referred to in order to describe the movement, does not convey the whole movement itself <span class="reference">(Bergson <a href="r.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:246)</span>. The line can be divided an infinite number of times, as shown in Zeno’s paradox <span class="reference">(Aristotle Physics, book VI)</span>,  but then we are only dividing ‘the line supposed to have been traversed, and not the movement traversing it’ <span class="reference">(Bergson <a href="r.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:246)</span>. The whole movement is already given instantly by our perception. Concrete parameters cannot be drawn around movement itself, only the divisible path we imagine to retrospectively describe it.</div>
<br>	
<div>Real movement is absolutely relative <span class="reference">(Bergson <a href="r.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:254-255,267)</span>. In physics, movement can be considered a universal phenomenon of the acentred whole <span class="reference">(Bergson <a href="r.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:254)</span>. Everything is moving in relation to everything else on both a macro and a micro scale. Descriptions of these movements can only be extracted once a point of reference or centre is selected and a line is drawn between the points. But these details will only describe a change over time within those finite parameters. Real movement is relative to an infinite number of points in addition to our bodies. Thus, movements are acentred vibrations encompassing the entire universe.</div>
<br>	
<div>Bergson <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>)</span> rejected distinctions between the subject and the object in the same way. The body is not immune to the above critique of parameters and limits; there is no absolute threshold separating it from other objects grouped together to understand the world; ‘the visual perception of an object, the brain, nerves, retina and the object itself form a connected whole’ <span class="reference">(Bergson <a href="r.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:285)</span>. Perception, as a movement, cannot be divided into sections and still retain the whole that is immediately given, as would be necessary to distinguish subject and object. Neither can one’s body be placed at the centre of all movements in the universe without losing the image of the whole movement <span class="reference">(Bergson <a href="r.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:260)</span>. In this way, pure subjectivity and individual identity are turned away from real movement.</div>
<br>	
<div>Deleuze <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>)</span> used these same Bergsonian arguments against dualism to describe the cinema. In Bergson’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>, <a href="r.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>)</span> description of movement, there is always another division to be made, another body in space from which to measure the trajectory’s relative position and another position itself, constantly emerging. In cinema, Deleuze saw that there was always another shot, always another frame that is different from the one before it as an acentred movement through space and time. Thus, through montage, by virtue of the movement becoming acentred, cinema comes closer to real movement than natural perception. The essence of the cinema is to transcend the subject and the object through acentred movements.</div>
<br>	
<div>At least, this is one way of describing the creative evolution that has taken place: the cinema’s gradual discovery of the mobilisation of its sections in pursuit of the new. This is what Deleuze <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:141-177; <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>)</span> charts in <em>Cinema 1</em> and <em>Cinema 2</em>, from the centred action-image where everything is confined to react to the centre of a set, to the acentred time-image, where a linear narrative is abandoned to mobilise the image further. Cinema does not give us an illusion of movement through immobile sections, it mobilises sections through qualitative change or the production of the new <span class="reference">(Deleuze <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:9)</span>.</div>
