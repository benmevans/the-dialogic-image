	<h3>2-4 There is no montage in gameplay</h3>
		
<div>Deleuze <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:24)</span> asks, ‘What happened when the camera was fixed?’, leading into a description of ‘a primitive state of the cinema where the image is in movement rather than being a movement-image’. This is how the early cinema, its essence not yet realised, imitated the mediums that preceded it like theatre, photography or natural perception <span class="reference">(Deleuze <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:25)</span>. The idea of montage had not yet emerged, so in this early version of the medium, ‘there is therefore no communication of mutually referring variable sets’ <span class="reference">(Deleuze 1983/2013:24)</span>. Shots were stationary and the movements within were spatially determined <span class="reference">(Deleuze <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:3,24)</span>. Movement was therefore localised to the things themselves, like scientific representations of movement, the cinematographic illusion amounts to points on a line over time <span class="reference">(Deleuze <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:24)</span>. This absolute centre, around which the characters and objects are referenced, means relativity is also absent. While the movement-image’s genesis cannot be truly identified, for the same reason a point on a trajectory is only a convenience and can always be made more precise, we can at least say that early cinema did not yet provide what Deleuze calls a movement-image.</div>
<br>
<div>But this lack of mutually referring sets preventing early cinema from achieving a movement-image is what we find in most videogames, at least during gameplay.  Montage generally goes against the idea of fluid and comprehensible gameplay. In the <a href="https://youtu.be/5jveLZT-Dgw?t=208" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em> Remake dance battle</a> mentioned earlier, the player must push different buttons in time with the music to make Cloud dance. The camera is completely mobile, constantly cutting to different shots, making the entire process disorientating and difficult to play. I just wanted to watch Cloud dance but was instead forced to concentrate on a tiny spot on the screen telling me which button to push and when, as it changed position with every new shot. This demonstrates a tension in videogame design between a desire to move towards what is appealing in a cinematographic language and the parameters necessary to make gameplay clear, intelligible, and fair for players.</div>
<!-- Here lets add a video of that dance sequence -->
<br> 
<div>Thus, videogames mark an involuntary return, in a sense, to the static camera of early cinema to clarify its gameplay elements. Restricting camera movement also restricts the key innovations of early cinema that led to the movement-image. There is, therefore, something fundamental in the gesture of videogames running counter to Bergson’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:337; <a href="r.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>)</span> descriptions of real movement.</div>
<br>		
<div id="2.4p4">Cutscenes might be described as an exception when the camera ceases to provide a single continuous shot. But even if we follow Keogh’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Keogh 2018" target="_blank" title="Keogh B (2018) A play of bodies: how we perceive videogames">2018</a>:118)</span> argument and include cutscenes as part of the videogame event, cutscenes still depend on gameplay for the role they play in a videogame. As we saw at the beginning of <a href="2.1.html" target="_blank">this level</a>, cutscenes represent what is most analytically familiar to us and what is easiest to articulate in the phenomenon. However, this is not to suggest cutscenes and cinema are the same thing or have the same effect on the player. In the case of a cutscene, one's orientation towards the images is completely different. Someone could walk in on the final cutscene of a Hideo Kojima <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Kojima 2008" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2008) Metal gear solid 4: guns of the patriots [videogame]">2008</a>, <a href="r.html#Kojima 2015" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2015) Metal gear solid V: the phantom pain [videogame]">2015</a>, <a href="r.html#Kojima 2019" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2019) Death stranding [videogame]">2019</a>, etc.)</span> game and feel like they were watching a movie, but the player would have a different experience. That difference emerges out of the cutscene’s proximity to gameplay for the player. During gameplay the camera is tied to a single point, like the playable character or arena, in order to facilitate player agency. That context precedes any Deleuzian images we could identify in the cutscene as a text. That history of agency frames what the cutscene means and what it is accomplishing. For, the production of a new videogame image is the result of player agency within the image event. In contrast, the technique of montage is an interruption, a removal of agency. Compared to a videogame, a film has already happened. I had not finished taking in the futuristic depictions of Los Angeles in <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> <span class="reference">(Villeneuve <a href="r.html#Villeneuve 2017" target="_blank" title="Villeneuve D (director) (2017) Blade Runner 2049 [motion picture]">2017</a>)</span>, but the story kept moving regardless. A videogame must give me time, like a novel or comics, if it is to be, as Galloway<!-- reference --> says, an action. And unlike other mediums, the videogame can also provide space, in addition to time, as another plane on which agency can be applied. One cost of this is the tethering of the camera to my decisions.</div>
