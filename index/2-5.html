	<h3>2-5 There is no movement in <em>Street Fighter</em></h3>
		
<div>We can see this most clearly in 2D fighting games like <em>Street Fighter</em> <span class="reference">(Funamizu et al. <a href="r.html#Funamizu 1995" target="_blank" title="Funamizu N, Murata H and Itsuno H (designers) (1995) Street fighter alpha 3 [videogame]">1995</a>; Nakayama <a href="r.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>; Nishiyama <a href="r.html#Nishiyama 1987" target="_blank" title="Nishiyama T (director) (1987) Street fighter [videogame]">1987</a>; Okamoto <a href="r.html#Okamoto 1991" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y (director) (1991) Street fighter II [videogame]">1991</a>; Okamoto et al. <a href="r.html#Okamoto 1999" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y, Funamizu N and Nakajima (producers) (1999) Street fighter III: 3rd strike [videogame]">1999</a>; Tsukamoto <a href="r.html#Tsukamoto 2008" target="_blank" title="Tsukamoto T (director) (2008) Street fighter IV [videogame]">2008</a>)</span> where there are no changing perspectives, not even via the direction of a Lakitu Bro., and the camera is static save some automatic adjustments along a two dimensional plane to keep both players in view. Centred illusions of movement give us a single shot that is a side-on view of both player's characters. Thus, while Deleuze <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>)</span> was able to redeem cinema from Bergson’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>:194-195)</span> critique of the cinematographic illusion through a description of cinema’s acentred movements, in <em>Street Fighter</em> the critique finds a new home. The character animations in <em>Street Fighter</em>, like early cinema, only imitate movement with a series of still frames and the by-product is an illusion and does not, according to Deleuze’s descriptions of cinema, constitute real movement.</div>

<div>Finishing moves are a brief exception to this in the franchise’s more recent instalments. But these, as a rule, must be short because the player cannot control their character while they are happening. The insertion of cinematographic techniques here is used to implement how long the move takes to accomplish and elevate the spectacle and drama of a fight. But there is a feeling that the game proper has been paused in these instances, like watching a replay in sport after missing the actual in-game occurrence it is a reproduction of. Once this brief change in perspective has been accomplished, we can get back to the fight, along with all the rigid parameters that make it possible.</div>

<div>We can see in <em>Street Fighter</em> that this apprehension of the camera does place a kind of limit on space and time as a result of having given them to the player. In cinema, the viewer has no control over them but the camera relishes in their manipulation. <em>Street Fighter</em> only exists within a set of tight parameters, an idea obviously counter to Bergson’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>)</span> descriptions of real movement. The actions available to the player are limited; there are three punch buttons, three kick buttons and a directional pad or stick to move the player’s avatar left and right, to crouch and jump. A border encloses the animations, and nothing exists outside it. The available illusions of movements create a finite illusion of space. After a match, the illusion of space and time is destroyed, for, available contributing actions are zero and the successive equidistant frames have ceased. In this way, the parameters of <em>Street Fighter</em>, as a video<em>game</em> ‘circumscribed within limits of space and time’ <span class="reference">(Caillois <a href="r.html#Caillois 2001" target="_blank" title="Caillois R (1961/2001) Man, play, and games">1961/2001</a>:9)</span>, come from the limits placed on the illusions of movement in-game. The animations or illusions of movement as actions chosen by the player, not movement-images, are foundational to the entire experience of <em>Street Fighter</em>. The player has extended a part of themselves into the event of the image or cinematographic illusion as it is being produce and some limitations are necessary for that to occur; developers give players a finite set of possibilities.</div>
<br>
<div>This is how the human participates in the production of a videogame image, i.e. the event of image production in dialogic collaboration with a developer who has established parameters to create a space for player agency. This problematic emerged for us and we are so far coming to terms with it in the same way we came to terms with the fixed camera following Mario in <em>Super Mario 64</em>. That is, via the concepts of, and in contrast to, the cinema.</div>
