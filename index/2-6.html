	<h3>2-6 What is a videogame?</h3>
		
<div>The description of videogames as a human event is counter to agendas that seek to define what a videogame is. Rough <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Rough 2018" target="_blank" title="Rough B (2018) ‘Videogames as neither video nor games: a negative ontology’">2018</a>:33)</span>, in his definition, gives some examples of videogames without any visual component at all, like ‘videogames for the visually impaired’, to prove that video or images are nonessential to the phenomenon. But the character animations <em>are</em> an essential part of <em>Street Fighter</em> and autonomy over them is how we experience the game. This is not to use <em>Street Fighter</em> to say something general that can be applied to all videogames. Rather, <em>Street Fighter</em> reveals something the videogame is doing with the cinematographic illusion. This speaks to the possibilities of human experience in relation to videogames as a dialogic and evolving event. As an event, rigid definitions of the videogame prevent us from following along with it. <span class="reference">Though I persistently combine the words ‘video’ and ‘game’ to encourage an understanding of the videogame as its own seperate phenomenon and not a combination of the two, in the situation of the present paragraph we could say ‘<em>video-game</em>’ in the same way Wittgenstein (<!-- reference -->) employs the term, ‘<em>language-game</em>’. Like language, videogames are not something to be confined with criteria but are a means by which we generate new criteria and associations.</span> I will use the word ‘game’ to refer to a videogame for the same reason. ‘Game’, ‘gaming’ and ‘gamer’ are all words used to identify with and refer to the experience of playing a videogame. Why should we not allow the phenomenon of the videogame to change and influence our understand of what a game is — discover new uses for it in the language-game? Games are also human events, as is video and the cinematographic illusion. Videogames give us an opportunity to explore the coalescence of these elements within <em>and not as elements of</em> an entirely new mode. If we set criteria prior to any engagement with the event itself, we risk occluding our view of the emergence of the new.</div>
<br>		
<div><a href="2.4.html#2.4p4" target="_blank" title="'Someone could walk in on the final cutscene of a Hideo Kojima game and feel like they were watching a movie, but the player would have a different experience.'">Above</a> I mentioned the possibility of regarding a typical Kojima <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Kojima 2008" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2008) Metal gear solid 4: guns of the patriots [videogame]">2008</a>, <a href="r.html#Kojima 2015" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2015) Metal gear solid V: the phantom pain [videogame]">2015</a>, <a href="r.html#Kojima 2019" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2019) Death stranding [videogame]">2019</a>, etc.)</span> game as a film and it is possible to do this with any videogame. Videogames have the potential to contain films within them – a movie could be playing on a TV screen in the gameworld, a cutscene can be taken out of context, and player autonomy can be ignored and we can pretend that gameplay is just another shot of a film. Some have taken this to mean the videogame, and those ambitions attached to it like VR, represent the next evolutionary step in visual media through a lens of progressivism. Our own Kojima <span class="reference">(cited in Gibson <a href="r.html#Gibson 2006" target="_blank" title="Gibson E (24 January 2006) 'Games aren’t art, says Kojima'">2006</a>)</span> famously gave license to this line of thought when he said,</div>
<blockquote class="small">…Art is the stuff you find in the museum, whether it be a painting or a statue. What I’m doing, what videogame creators are doing, is running the museum - how do we light up things, where do we place things, how do we sell tickets? For better or worse, what I do, Hideo Kojima, myself, is run the museum and also create the art that’s displayed in the museum.</blockquote>
<br>		
<div>But here, Kojima is describing an inherent quality of images generally. Everyone who sees the painting, <a href="https://i.ibb.co/nk3Zkx8/1280px-Whistlers-Mother-high-res.jpg" target="_blank" title="Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1"><em>Whistler’s Mother</em></a> <span class="reference">(Whistler <a href="r.html#Whistler 1871" target="_blank" title="Whistler JM (1871) Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1 [painting]">1871</a>)</span>, notices the painting within a painting, hanging on the wall. It has always been possible to contain images within other images, leading to new contexts and experiences in relation to the image. While videogames certainly entail new ways of encountering images, we must not forget that Kojima’s museum is, itself, an image. This is not a feature that makes videogames a unique human experience, neither is it why they are interesting.</div>
<br>		
<div>But the most straight forward critique here might be Žižek’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Žižek 2008" target="_blank" title="Žižek S (2008) The plague of fantasies">2008</a>)</span>, which he gave in relation to cyberspace, regarding the ‘unbearable closure of being’. For, unlike an actual museum, the gameworld is inevitably closed, there is a finitude in how the experience is contained and does not overflow me. Of course, a videogame can be infinite in a mathematical sense, in a sense convenient to the computer. But Žižek’s point is that this type of infinity is exactly what leads to the closure, a phenomenon revealing all its parts indefinitely with nothing that is, in principle, inaccessible. A randomly generated world might extend forever while at the same time concealing very little. In videogames we do not need to wonder; we do not need an excess.</div>
<br>		
<div>Now, if there is something that distinguishes the various image mediums like painting, photography, cinema or videogames, it is not that each one represents a higher order, like the idea that each new medium contains all the previous ones within it. It is that each medium entails a new way of using images to orientate us towards the Real, towards something irreducible and open. In the case of videogames specifically it is towards the image itself as imminent lived experience, towards the image as an irreducible event. Hence, this project is interested in videogames for the way they orient us in relation to the event of the image, which is to move beyond the perception of the videogame image being a collection of calculated and pre-planned frames, and beyond the videogame image as a limited version of the Deleuze’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>)</span> movement-image.</div>
<br>		
<div> Compared to other mediums today, paintings provide a profound lack of stimulation and detail regarding space and time, we have to lend those elements to it ourselves. There is not enough detail to make out most of the dancers is Renoir’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Renoir 1876" target="_blank" title="Renoir PA (1876) Bal du moulin de la Galette [painting]">1876</a>)</span> <em>Bal du moulin de la Galette</em>, not to mention all those that have been chopped off in the framing of the image. But ‘chopped off’ is a photographical way of describing it anyway, inappropriate for a painting. The dancers which are not in the frame, those which Renoir never painted are an essential component of the experience of the image and, in one important sense, the whole point. I am not referring to the closure we see in gestalt theory, where the incomplete fragments of an object suggest the whole to perception. Rather, the entire purpose of that which was painted is to persuade us towards a more vague and mysterious experience of that which was not. Becoming acquainted with the latter, which is to make our contribution to the painting as viewer, is what pulls us into the picture. If every border, the moment we experience that boundary, spawned a new image, we will have indeed stumbled into Žižek’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Žižek 2008" target="_blank" title="Žižek S (2008) The plague of fantasies">2008</a>)</span> ‘unbearable closure’. The confinement of the painting directs us towards the mystery of the forecloser of the lived event of the image as something which cannot be fully described.</div>

	<figcaption class="small">Figure 11: Renoir's (<a href="r.html#Renoir 1876" target="_blank" title="Renoir PA (1876) Bal du moulin de la Galette [painting]">1876</a>) <em>Bal du moulin de la Galette</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>
<div>Cinema not only enables movement through space within the image itself, but the montage allows images to be juxtaposed and communicate temporally. The role of time here is an important thing to note because comics, McCloud <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#McCloud 1994" target="_blank" title="McCloud S (1994) Understanding comics: the invisible art">1994</a>:7-8)</span> famously illustrates, also juxtapose images sequentially, albeit through space on the page. Next to comics, cinema is the creative evolution of sequential images when the temporal experience of each section has been surrendered over to the machine, or to the film-maker via the machine. This process, along with photography and the cinematographic illusion, enabled the image to become something new, as we have seen Deleuze <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>; <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>)</span> explore. Because we have no control over the camera, a sense of wonder can be constantly evoked through the composition of the shot and montage. The cinema is, in a sense, always beyond us and outside our control and this constitutes the image-event of cinema.</div>
<br>		
<div>And this is all another way of describing what Antoine de Saint-Exupéry <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Saint-Exupéry 1943" target="_blank" title="Saint-Exupéry A (1943/2020) The little prince">1943/2020</a>)</span> was expressing when he wrote the <em>The Little Prince</em>. At the end of the story, the Little Prince is dying and the star that is his home is too small to point out; ‘It’s better that way. My star will be just another star in the sky. That way you’ll love watching all the stars’ <span class="reference">(Saint-Exupéry <a href="r.html#Saint-Exupéry 1943" target="_blank" title="Saint-Exupéry A (1943/2020) The little prince">1943/2020</a>:100)</span>. The Little Prince understands the need for mystery to give things meaning, to be able to give ourselves to them, to surrender.</div>
<br>		
<div>Are videogames, then, another example of the image’s yielding to closer, like Žižek’s <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Žižek 2008" target="_blank" title="Žižek S (2008) The plague of fantasies">2008</a>)</span> descriptions of cyberspace? <em>Star Citizen</em> <span class="reference">(Roberts <a href="r.html#Roberts n.d." target="_blank" title="Roberts C (n.d.) Star citizen [videogame]">n.d.</a>)</span>, <em>No Man Sky</em> <span class="reference">(Murry et al. <a href="r.html#Murry 2016" target="_blank" title="Murry S, Duncan G, Doyle R and Ream D (directors) (2016) No man’s sky [videogame]">2016</a>)</span> or <em>Elite Dangerous</em> <span class="reference">(Braben <a href="r.html#Braben 2014" target="_blank" title="Braben D (director) (2014) Elite dangerous [videogame]">2014</a>)</span> represent an ambition in videogames which nullifies the Little Prince’s dying gesture. They are moving towards a gameworld in which the stars and planets players see in the sky are accessible destinations, which can be intimately explored. The orbiting planets in <em>Outer Wilds</em> <span class="reference">(Beachum <a href="r.html#Beachum 2019" target="_blank" title="Beachum A (director) (2019) Outer wilds [videogame]">2019</a>)</span> are something to be accessed, solved and overcome, rather than something to be overcome by.</div>
<br>		
<div>This brings us to a more revealing problematic to be explored in relation to videogames than any attempt at definitions. That is to identify the medium’s point of openness, the location of the event. Where is the irreducible event in the videogame as an image? And this is the same as asking where the human is in the videogame image. This can be answered with a description of how the image is made, or how we collaborate in the production of a videogame image in a way that is unambiguous, on display, part of the image itself, not an interpretation – the image becomes an explicit human event.</div>
