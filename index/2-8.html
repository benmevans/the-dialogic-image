	<h3>2-8 How to win at <em>Street Fighter</em></h3>
		
<div>Playing <em>Street Fighter V</em> <span class="reference">(Nakayama <a href="r.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>)</span> well can entail a deep understanding of its character animations. This is true to the point where the illusions of movement are broken, and animations are temporarily regarded to be a series of separate equidistant still images. Each character animation has a set number of startup, active and recovery frames. Startup frames describe how many frames of animation take place before any damage is inflicted on the opponent, during which the player is vulnerable. Active frames are those in which an attack does damage if the opponent crosses the path of the action and fails to block. Recovery frames are those frames in which a character is completing the animation and cannot yet commence a new one, during which the player is vulnerable. This ‘frame date’ can be central to how one plays the game, especially at a high level. A familiarity is recommended, at least with the character one plays the most <span class="reference">(Munday <a href="r.html#Munday 2016" target="_blank" title="Munday J (2016) Gief’s gym: a guide to Street Fighter V">2016</a>:257)</span>. For example, Sakura’s standing light punch in <em>Street Fighter V</em> <span class="reference">(Nakayama <a href="r.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>)</span> has 4 frames on startup, 3 active and 8 recovery compared to her standing heavy punch which has 9 frames on startup, 3 active and 21 recovery <span class="reference">(Capcom <a href="r.html#Capcom n.d." target="_blank" title="Capcom (n.d.a) Frame List | SAKURA">n.d.</a>)</span>.</div>

<div>The latter does more damage but requires more startup and recovery frames and is therefore less safe. This vulnerability can be overcome, however, by using combos, i.e. linking certain attacks together so that the proceeding attack connects to or interrupts the recovery frames of the attack before it. Frame data also plays a role in ‘frame trapping’ which is to create a situation where an opponent’s attack can be interrupted with a counter-attack that has fewer startup frames <span class="reference">(Munday <a href="r.html#Munday 2016" target="_blank" title="Munday J (2016) Gief’s gym: a guide to Street Fighter V">2016</a>:260)</span>. Though it is not essential, familiarity with frame data can make frame trapping possible in many situations. Thus, character animations in <em>Street Fighter</em> come to have meaning beyond the illusions of movement. In many ways, understanding the animations as illusions is important to comprehend the mechanics of the game.</div>
<br>		
<div>Note that frame data transcends, and is not transcendental to, the spectacle of the cinematographic illusion. Attempting to combo into a special attack means trying to complete the action within a set number of frames but an awareness of these frames only augment the illusions of movement. This page is to show that our chances of winning improve as the concept of individual frames comes to determine actions. The frames constitute the data of a science of <em>Street Fighter</em>; we use frame data to articulate and think through potential and occurring scenarios, to solve the problems emerging from a lived image-event. During a match, however, any considerations of separate frames will be brief; the mind will only temporarily dip beneath the surface of the illusion before being thrust back into the spectacle of a complete Spinning Bird Kick. This means that an awareness of the cinematographic illusion and taking advantage of certain scenarios through a knowledge of the same, does not undermine the effects of the illusion for our bodies, as perceiving special objects, during gameplay. Soon, we will move into a culminating analyses of the role that special object plays in the image-event, that is how we <strong>consume</strong> the image. For now it is enough to flag the role of the body in passing. The present point is that as our skills improve in <em>Street Fighter</em> as an awareness of perceived movement <em>as illusion</em> increasingly comes to determine how we play, our decisions and how we collaborate to <strong>produce</strong> the image. This learned new orientation towards the image, despite its disassembling the image into separate frames, and despite its abstracting thought away from that which is immediately given to us as bodies — more than ‘despite’ but through this very process — the image comes to have greater meaning in the immediate lived experience of the player. Players do not count frames in real-time during a match but character animations are manipulated as illusions of movement and the more we play the more clear this status becomes and the more practised we become at regarding them as such. Frame data plays an important role in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of one’s chosen character in certain situations. The game’s developer, Capcom <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Capcom n.d." target="_blank" title="Capcom (n.d.a) Frame List | SAKURA">n.d.</a>)</span>, makes all of <em>Street Fighter V’s</em> <span class="reference">(Nakayama <a href="r.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>)</span> frame data available on their website and certain tools in that game’s training mode are designed to facilitate a comprehension of frame data while practising. In this sense, learning to play <em>Street Fighter</em> could be described as the process of intellectually <em>unseeing</em> the perceived movement in the image, but this <em>unseeing</em> is an addition to the lived experience of the image and it is not a return to the base of things.</div>
<br>
<div>While none of this is essential to play or even win the game and one enviably learns how to exploit the limitations of the game’s systems over time through gameplay, never mind frame data <span class="reference">(Munday <a href="r.html#Munday 2016" target="_blank" title="Munday J (2016) Gief’s gym: a guide to Street Fighter V">2016</a>:256-257)</span>, playing the game conditions actions to be partially determined by the fact that the animations in the game are not real movements. For example, it is possible to learn through trial and error that special attacks can interrupt recovery frames. This phenomenon is only possible because the animations are finite and divisible. Exploiting this fact does not entail cheating or breaking the game but the exact opposite, that is how we play and even win the game. So, concerning what is perceived as movement in-game, to win at <em>Street Fighter</em> one needs to unlearn what movement is according to natural intuition in order to perform the movement differently, in unnatural ways. This unlearning/unseeing will be comprehended not only intellectually but through the body, through muscle memory that superposes a formal knowledge of frame data.</div>
<br>
<div>What is perceived as movement in <em>Street Fighter</em> is a finite series of still images and extracting that illusion is a process that resembles scientific inquiry. Outside videogames, to modify real movement or intervene in an action from one’s own body or that of another, we already divide movement artificially <span class="reference">(Bergson <a href="r.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/1907</a>:191-192)</span>. This process of division can go on forever indefinitely in scientific inquiry, never getting any closer to real movement <span class="reference">(Bergson <a href="r.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>:214-215)</span>. However, the illusions of movement in <em>Street Fighter</em> are phenomena scientific thought can get to the bottom of, which is exactly what one must do to improve at the game. The animations are divided into sections to intervene in an action, but unlike real movement, this process has an end. The ceiling is rapidly reached, and no further divisions are necessary, the inquiry is complete. A clear definite division separating cause and effect can be easily located. Thus, the future can be grasped in its entirety. The production of the new, its ever upspringing, can be stayed and we can win the game.</div>
<br>		
<div>This is what happens in a combo string. Because the movements are not real and the number of frames is finite, the effect of a cause can be locked in until the string of connected attacks is over. There is no frame gap in which the opponent can intervene a counter, the number of possible actions their avatar can perform has been reduced to zero. At the start of a match, possible false movements orbit each player’s character in a virtual plane. <span class="reference">(By ‘virtual’ we do not mean that which is computated but the whole from which potentialities are actualised; see Deleuze <a href="r.html#Deleuze 1996/2018" target="_blank" title="Deleuze (1996/2018) Bergsonism">1998/2018</a>:60)</span>. There is potentiality surrounding the character, multiple pathways present themselves before they are forced to coalesce into a single point, a single animation or illusion of movement. A match in <em>Street Fighter</em> can thus be described as a series of fluctuations, with the number of potential actions expanding and shrinking. Each player is attempting to force the virtual lines into a single point that is a win state for them. This is accomplished through an understanding of the movements as illusions, as was described above in the form of frame data, to enable frame trapping and strategic combo strings.</div>
<br>		
<div>In <em>Street Fighter</em>, autonomy is what generates real movement; agency mobilises still frames through creative unforeseeable gestures. Finite parameters constitute the strategic elements of the game and the deeper the grasp one has of these, the more meaningful, intentional and autonomous one’s actions in the game become. The creative comprehension and manipulation of finite significations is an indivisible movement towards a win state.</div>
<br>		
<div>This indivisible path or real movement could so far be described as centred, framed via a description of how to win the game or a single player’s experience with a computer, pushing towards a singular outcome. But the actual event of the videogame image is an acentred movement because there are multiple agencies working, dialogically and in conflict in any videogame instance, including single player. I remains for us to examine the constituents of a <em>Street Fighter</em> match as a shared becoming, a single creative event.</div>
