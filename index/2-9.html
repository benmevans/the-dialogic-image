	<h3>2-9 The dialogic image (a)</h3>
	
<div>To play <em>Street Fighter</em> is to participate in a kind of interhuman dialogue, which is both visual and kinesthetic. During a match, the actions of the opponent, displayed on the monitor, can be regarded as a series of questions that demand a response. These should not be thought of as literal questions, only as impetuses which are directed at the player and which demand action. These questions would lose all meaning if the player was absent, they are what it means to play the game and participate in <em>Street Fighter</em> as an act of dialogue. Responses are, in turn, also questions to an opponent and what is shared in this mutuality constitutes the novel dialogue of the game. This is only made possible through the unique visual language of illusions of movement provided by the game’s developers via the apparatus.</div>
<br>		
<div>This dialogue is irreducible, however, and the separate elements of question and answer can mislead us from this fact. The question precedes the response in time, it anticipates a response, but the question has not become fully actualised, its full meaning and implications do not emerge, until after the answer has been given. The question to which the action was a reply becomes suddenly more apparent, it becomes real. But an answer is also a question and that question will be constantly renewed, taking on new meaning and becoming mobilised in the unfolding events of a match. This new meaning cannot be predicted just as an opponent’s emerging response will continue to introduce new and unforeseen elements. The dialogue itself is not located in the back and forth motion of question and answer. It happens in neither the question nor the answer, not in one player or the other or the developer’s anticipations. It is, following Buber <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>; <a href="r.html#Buber 1965" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1965) The knowledge of man">1965</a>)</span> here, in the in-betweenness of the participants.</div>
<br>		
<div>We can come closer to understanding the shared creative act of a <em>Street Fighter</em> match by furthering this resemblance to Buberian dialogue and borrowing some distinctions Buber <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:10-12)</span> made, namely ‘observing’, ‘looking on’ and ‘becoming aware’. <span class="reference">We should not employ these terms as a means of distinguishing different phenomena because every videgame image (and every image generally) can be regarded in a way that is dialogic. Rather, the terms should be regarded as a means of distinguishing different ways <em>we</em> have oriented ourselves towards the phemonena and not as a description of the phenomena itself. The examples I use below bely false distinctions within the phenomena itself, but they do represent instances where the orientation in question comes more easily, so let them stand.</span></div>
<br>
<div>We could say we are ‘observing’ when we play against a dummy in the practice mode of <em>Street Fighter V</em> <span class="reference">(Nakayama <a href="r.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>)</span> which has been programmed to perform a series of moves in a desired sequence. But dialogue will never emerge from our interaction with this dummy, its animations will be learnt in a rote manner and only ‘observed’ <span class="reference">(Buber <a href="r.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:10)</span>. That is, we can accumulate recognisable traits and patterns that can be memorised and this can play an important part of what is required to improve one’s skills and anticipate the sequence of moves we have programmed, but this only points towards and cannot replace the dialogic act of playing a match where indetermination extends beyond us into an otherness.</div>
<br>
<div>A deeper understanding can come from describing what Buber <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:10)</span> calls ‘the onlooker’. Here, we disregard any attempt to learn individual elements, remember or even acknowledge them. The phenomenon is taken as a whole, as a single impression. We say to ourselves, ‘I will not try to “figure out” my opponent in a deliberate and calculated way, I will seize the advantages that come from skipping all that, looking passed separate elements or instances at something more complete’. This gesture, like observing, plays an important role in the process of learning the game and winning a match. There is a general awareness that only comes from prolonged experience with the game, which also applies to the non-specific comprehension of an opponent. While this can bring us closer to the human or object that is our subject in many ways, we have not yet arrived at the kind of awareness and state that is only made possible through dialogue.</div>
<br>		
<div>This ‘becoming aware’ <span class="reference">(Buber <a href="r.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:12)</span> is identifiable in <em>Street Fighter</em> because the actions of my opponent in the game, the questions described above, are all <em>to me</em>. What is being displayed on the monitor ‘speaks something that enters into my own life’ and demands my immediate action <span class="reference">(Buber <a href="r.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:11)</span>. In the previous two kinds of awareness, the human or object I am seeking to comprehend is separate from me but in <em>Street Fighter</em> ‘this man is not my object; I have got to do with him’ <span class="reference">(Buber <a href="r.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:11)</span></div>. A film or book can say things that feel unique and personal based on my interpretation of the text, but it is only an interpretation; what is unique in videogames, the novelty that is emerging, is shared between us at that moment and is incomplete. This is a novelty that we <em>become aware</em> of because we are part of its emergence.</div>
<br>		
<div>In <em>Street Fighter</em>, the fact that there are win and lose states distracts us from the dialogic nature of the phenomenon. The competitive nature of the game does not inhibit dialogue. Competition entails more than setting one’s opponent at a distance from oneself to establish difference — I won, you lost. For Elias <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Elias 1978" target="_blank" title="Elias N (1978) What is sociology?">1978</a>:130)</span>, player interdependence can entail both ‘an interdependence of allies or of opponents’ and our use of Buber <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Buber 1965" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1965) The knowledge of man">1965</a>:69)</span> here paints the latter as acceptance of otherness:</div>
<blockquote class="small">…man learns not merely that he is limited by man, cast upon his own finitude, partialness, need of completion, but his own relation to truth is heightened by the other’s different relation to the same truth.</blockquote>
<div>In a <em>Street Fighter</em> match, we are confronted with the paradox of an alternative interpretation of the same truths, the same finite game mechanics, which are yet not the same, and cannot be controlled or predicted. This phenomenon amounts to something of a violence on our person, on that distance presupposed, an attack on the objectification of the other,</div>	
<blockquote class="small">…each becomes aware of the other and is thus related to him in such a way that he does not regard and use him as an object, but as his partner in a living event, even if it is no more than a boxing match. (Buber <a href="r.html#Buber 1965" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1965) The knowledge of man">1965</a>:64) </blockquote>
<div>A distance is present before a match begins, and a distance is established by the outcome of the match, but these facts should only throw into relief for us what is mutual during the match itself.</div>
