	<h3>3-15 Imaging Violence</h3>
		
<div><em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is a series of violent images and in this way, it presents a response to the anthropological question. But that is where its resemblance to ethnography ends. From here, it will be more productive to liken this videogame to anthropological fieldwork because players are required to participate in the generation of violent images in a more radical and explicit way than in a text or film. The primal word in videogames, for Galloway (<a href="r.html#Galloway 2006" target="_blank" title="Galloway AR (2006) Gaming: essays on algorithmic culture">2006</a>:2), is ‘action’ because more than any other medium, a videogame is something that you do: ‘If photographs are images, and films are moving images, then video games are actions’. You push the button which triggers a murder scene. It is easier for critics to feign innocence in relation to a text because words can be made an object distinct from the volition of the person reading them. It is likewise easer to criticise the violence of a videogame you have never played and only seen the trailer for. But once you have actually played the game, some innocence has been lost because your agency has enabled the reduction of violence into a finite image, an encompassment of the other has been pretended. To understand videogame violence, one must play the game, but to play the game is to commit the reductive and totalising gesture described above, which I am arguing is violent.</div>

<div>Here I am locating videogame violence in the event of generating a violent image and not in what we identify as the image itself. One advantage of this position is how it allows us to maintain the true nature of violence as an embodied event. The body of the player plays a central role in the production of the image on the screen. The most obvious way this happens is, as has already been mentioned, by pushing a button or turning on the device.  But this also extends beyond videogames as ‘embodied and materially instantiated’ (Keogh <a href="r.html#Keogh 2018" target="_blank" title="Keogh B (2018) A play of bodies: how we perceive videogames">2018</a>:43) phenomena. Any image presupposes eyes for it to be viewed with and the position a person needs to be in to see and understand the image. Without a body gesturing, in a specific way, towards the pixels being displayed, there is no image, only a collection of pixels (for example, it is possible to perceive the pixels in a way that occludes the image by putting your face very close to the screen). As Merleau-Ponty (<a href="r.html#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:355) has shown, perception is an event that involves one’s entire body, every part expresses the intention and participates in coming to terms with a phenomenon. This full-body apprehension is an essential part of what a violent image is and of the violent gesture I have been identifying. In order to understand the violence of a particular phenomenon, we need to return to the body, which, as Foucault (<a href="r.html#Foucault 1975" target="_blank" title="Foucault M (1975/1995) Discipline and punish: the birth of the prison">1975/1995</a>:26) has famously argued, is the plane on which ‘relations of power and domination’ are produced.</div>
		
<div>To forget this aspect of violence, to ‘veil the body’ (Todes <a href="r.html#Todes 2001" target="_blank" title="Todes S (2001) Body and world">2001</a>:29) in such a way, constitutes an irreverence towards the body of the suffering other – which is the essence of violence. This is an idea that will always need to be returned to: bodily circumstances must be made explicit to contemplate and confront violence. But since Descartes (<a href="r.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>), it has been possible to avoid a confrontation with the body by disregarding it for the conditions of having experience in general (Todes <a href="r.html#Todes 2001" target="_blank" title="Todes S (2001) Body and world">2001</a>:38). To live in one’s body, as Cartesian dualism makes possible, enables a retreat from the ramifications of our bodily circumstances. The Cartesian stance holds that violence and survival might be necessary for the sake of my body, but that is not what I am fundamentally, and it does not describe the transcendental base of things. This has enabled Western philosophy to avoid a confrontation with the suffering body of the other. This is how idealism leads to a detachment which enables an ignorance of violence, as was expressed in Rosenzweig’s (<a href="r.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>)  criticism of Hegel (<a href="r.html#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>); the body has no place in Hegel’s pursuit of the absolute cognition of the all, fear of death is denied along with an acknowledgement of the suffering other. These bodies and the violence they experience have been occluded in Hegel’s grand narrative of dialectical notions. Spirit consumes everything, its progress is inevitable and the violence the body receives and the violence it commits is a non-issue.</div>
