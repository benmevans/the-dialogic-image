	<h3>3-4 Death Mechanics</h3>
		
<div>After viewing the footage from the aforementioned terrorist attack in Christchurch, the first-person perspective, with the gun visible at the bottom of the frame, immediately reminded me of many first-person shooter videogames I had played. Of course, in most games within the genre, the player’s role is not to shoot innocent people, but the aggression and violence are still present enough to make the footage from Christchurch reminiscent of the gesture. This is not a new association and was most notably draw from the Columbine shooting in 1999, even without the first-person footage to evoke the comparison (for example, Consalvo <a href="r.html#Consalvo 2003" target="_blank" title="Consalvo M (2003) ‘The monsters next door: media constructions of boys and masculinity’">2003</a>:38-39). And there are more recent examples, like Trump’s comments after two mass shootings that killed thirty-one people last year: ‘We must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace’ (Trump cited in Draper <a href="r.html#Draper 2019" target="_blank" title="Draper K (5 August 2019) ‘Video Games Aren’t Why Shootings Happen. Politicians Still Blame Them.’">2019</a>).</div>
		
<div>The themes I have explored above became associated with videogames in my mind after viewing the footage from the aforementioned terrorist attack in Christchurch. The first-person perspective, with the gun visible at the bottom of the frame, immediately reminded me first-person shooter videogames I had played. Of course, in most games within the genre, the player’s role is not to shoot innocent people, but the aggression and violence are still present. I am not here to present an argument regarding violence in videogames, this is just how I came to associate the medium with the human need for redemption and what it has to offer in relation to that need. I stumbled out of the vicious cycle Taylor (<a href="r.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>) described above — the loathing for the world and oneself that often develops as we try to cope with evil — as a result of the connection I made between how the moments before the attack were presented in the media and my own participation in a similar kind of depiction of violence found in first-person shooters. This kind of shift into everyday life and one’s participation in an imperfect and evil world is not dependent that connection, but it does highlight the kind of redemption generally on offer in the medium of videogames and how similar it is to Rosenzweig’s (<a href="r.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>) picture of philosophy or Ivan Karamazov’s returning of the ticket.</div>
		
<div>Most videogames treat player mortality in a very similar way. In order to progress, a section must be cleared without dying. If the character you control does die, the section is repeated. There is a great deal of variation within this trope, for example, some fast-paced platformers like <em>Super Meat Boy</em> (McMillen and Refenes <a href="r.html#McMillen 2010" target="_blank" title="McMillen E and Refenes T (designers) (2010) Super meat boy [videogame]">2010</a>) or <em>Celeste</em> (Thorson <a href="r.html#Thorson 2018" target="_blank" title="Thorson M (director) (2018) Celeste [videogame]">2018</a>) have quick re-spawn times and plenty of checkpoints while roguelikes like <em>Spelunky 2</em> (Yu <a href="r.html#Yu 2020" target="_blank" title="Yu D (director) (2020) Spelunky 2 [videogame]">2020</a>) have what is called ‘permadeath’ where the player has to start the whole game again. Regardless of how this kind of death mechanic is integrated into a particular game, the general notion is the same — if you die, you get to try again. We could attribute this mechanic to the historical development and genesis of the medium, or describe replayability as an essential component that gives games in the broader sense value. We could bring the existence of death as the taken for granted loose-state in videogames into question, picking up Chris Crawford’s (<a href="r.html#Crawford 1992" target="_blank" title="Crawford C (1992) 'GDC founder chris crawford's dragon speech'">1992</a>) famous critique of the medium’s obsession with spacial representation and the limitations that focus places on games themselves, violence and death in videogames then being the path of least resistance. Whatever the reason for this almost universal approach to player mortality, in light of what has been discussed in the previous sections, we can attribute the appeal of this game mechanic to a kind of redemption. When one plays a videogame, another identity within another world is often pretended and represented in some way, death is also represented, and though such is often done so in a way that is narratively complex, like in <em>Neir: Autamata</em> (Taro <a href="r.html#Taro 2017" target="_blank" title="Taro Y (director) (2017) Nier: Automata [videogame]">2017</a>) or <em>The Last of Us</em> (Straley and Druckmann <a href="r.html#Straley 2013" target="_blank" title="Straley B and Druckmann N (directors) (2013) The last of us [videogame]">2013</a>), there is little variation regarding that which makes videogames unique as a medium, namely game mechanics, or around that character in the story who the player will inevitably sympathise with, the character they control. Thus, even in games that supposedly have something to say about death and player mortality like <em>Dark Souls</em> (Miyazaki <a href="r.html#Miyazaki 2011" target="_blank" title="Miyazaki H (director) (2011) Dark souls [videogame]">2011</a>), the redemption it presents is the same — you get to try again until you win and feel good about yourself. The posture assumed here is leaning away from the lived reality of suffering and death in the world. Death in a videogame can be disappointing, but the experience of it is far removed from the trauma of real death. Death is repeatedly depicted in videogames, you could play Mega Man for five minutes and die five times in a row, but it is rarely confronted for what it is.</div>
