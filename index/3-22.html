	<h3>3-24 The Anthropological Question</h3>

<div>The anthropological question, which anthropology broadly addresses, goes like this: What is the human being? It has become more common to describe anthropology’s scope and mission with an emphasis on humanity’s diversity; for Ingold (<a href="r.html#Ingold 2014" target="_blank" title="Ingold T (2014) ‘That’s enough about ethnography!’">2014</a>:388), ‘to do anthropology’ is to study ‘the conditions and possibilities of being human’ and Strathern (<a href="r.html#Strathern 2005" target="_blank" title="Strathern M (2005) ‘Prologue’">2005</a>:xii) has located the ‘genius of anthropology’ in its ‘descriptive engagement with the act of description, with how people generate accounts of themselves’. These definitions of anthropology reflect styles of thought that have emerged in response to the anthropological question – What is the human? – and this is because there are complex ethical implications for anyone willing to take it up. Anthropology is like no other science. To contribute towards a description of what the human is, in a way that is anthropological, entails regarding the humans around us in a particular way – in a way that makes everything relevant to the question. Our relationships with people behove us to iterate on how we ask it, their gaze reflecting our own demands this much from us. But the question itself has stayed the same since Kant (<a href="r.html#Kant 1798" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1798/2006) Anthropology from a pragmatic point of view">1765/1992</a>:538) first asked it in his lectures, and is as violent today as it was then.</div>
		
<div>All anthropological research holds this question as its presupposition. This includes when ‘What is the human being?’ has not been expressly stated and the research has other explicit objectives, like the description of political violence, racism or drought and famine (Wutich and Brewis <a href="r.html#Wutich 2014" target="_blank" title="Wutich A and Brewis A (2014) ‘Food, water, and scarcity: toward a broader anthropology of resource insecurity’">2014</a>). Not only are these still relevant to this question of inexhaustible scope – the human being as a condition of asking questions has got to do with everything – but they contribute to its essential totalising gesture. The act of research assumes some ground can be gained regarding what the human is. This is even true of those reflexive researchers who go to the trouble of problematizing the anthropological question itself.</div>
		
<div>For example, Lévi-Strauss’ (<a href="r.html#Lévi–Strauss 1963" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1963) Structural anthropology">1963</a>) structural anthropology exemplifies the creative thinking that must take place when the anthropological question is confronted for its own sake. How can there be a specific object when ‘our researches transform their objects’ (Lévi-Strauss <a href="r.html#Lévi–Strauss 1963" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1963) Structural anthropology">1963</a>:19)? For, Lévi-Strauss understood that the anthropological question does not ask for a description of any specific object, but a description of what is conditional on there being any object whatever. The best we can do is show how the object in question is expressing itself: What is the structure of the human being as a performance? What are the elements of this structure? This is why Lévi-Strauss (<a href="r.html#Lévi–Strauss 1971" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1971) The scope of anthropology">1971</a>:16) associated social anthropology with semiology – ‘its object of study the life of signs at the heart of social life’ – and did not evoke social anthropology’s foundation in the anthropological question explicitly. To ask, ‘What is the human?’ and expect a straightforward description is too much. There is no ‘atom of kinship’ to be described,</div>
<blockquote class="small">…we do not need to explain how the maternal uncle emerged in the kinship structure: He does not emerge — he is present initially. Indeed, the presence of the maternal uncle is a necessary precondition for the structure to exist. (Lévi-Strauss <a href="r.html#Lévi–Strauss 1963" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1963) Structural anthropology">1963</a>:46)</blockquote>
<div>In this way, Levi-Strauss’ structural anthropology hinges on a Kantian critique,  which puts constraints on the question itself. We must only ask for an incomplete picture, a description of the relationship between humanity’s elements, rather than purporting to uncover the nature of the elements themselves. Thus, Lévi-Strauss demonstrates an acute awareness of the problematic nature of the anthropological question. And none of this awareness is distracting from the anthropological project but is the source of Lévi-Strauss’ most valuable contributions to the discipline and beyond, namely structuralism.</div>
		
<div>Nevertheless, the process of doing anthropology, then, is still an inexhaustible one and this scope is an inherent feature of all anthropological research. Lévi-Strauss’ (<a href="r.html#Lévi–Strauss 1971" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1971) The scope of anthropology">1971</a>) construal of the anthropological question — or any act of interpreting the question, creating a mission for anthropology, isolating what it means to do anthropology — does nothing to limit the object of inquiry. Conversely, it embraces its vastness, follows through, enacting an ambition equal to Kant’s (<a href="r.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>). Kantian inspired reflexivity towards the conditions of engagement, like structuralism, does give anthropology an object in the conditions themselves, a ‘wide and stormy ocean, the true home of illusion’ (Kant <a href="r.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>:A236), so vast that it consumes the researcher. And this reflects the totalising nature of the question. The act of limiting presupposes an object of inexhaustible scope, takes the question seriously, and thus participates in the question’s totalising gesture. The human will always be the most expansive object to study because it is the means by which there are any objects at all. This is what Kant (<a href="r.html#Kant 1798" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1798/2006) Anthropology from a pragmatic point of view">1765/1992</a>:538) meant when he made all philosophical questions subordinate to the anthropological one.</div>
