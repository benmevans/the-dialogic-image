	<h3>3-26 The Anthropological Image (b)</h3>
		
<div>All this means that the anthropological image of the human is a violent image. Of course, there is no single image of the human we can attribute to anthropology, here I am generalising out of necessity. The image in question is never singular and it is always changing and to properly show how and why anthropology’s image of the human is in its current orientation would require a long historical narrative – something like what Charles Taylor (<a href="r.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>; <a href="r.html#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>) has done for the modern sense of self and secular modernity. Such a detour would take us too far from the intentions of this project. All we need to go on with, is an idea of the general gesture, as it stands of what anthropology has been up to lately and why that image has not escaped the violence described in the previous section.</div>
		
<div>Now, of course some of the most recent developments in the discipline have been an effort overcome this violence through an anti-colonialism. We see this in Viveiros de Castro’s (<a href="r.html#Viveiros de Castro 2014" target="_blank" title="Viveiros de Castro E (2014) Cannibal Metaphysics">2014</a>:40) definition when he defines anthropology or describes its new task as the decolonisation of thought. The problematic he uses to introduce this idea in <em>Cannibal Metaphysics</em> is exactly Kantian. He is asking where anthropology’s ideas come from, the colonialist stance being to attribute them to the anthropologist herself or the discourse emerging within the discipline, the decolonising stance would be to attribute anthropological insight back to the people anthropologists study, to give it back to them, and elevate them as potential anthropologists.  Viveiros de Castro wants to address a similar problem to Kant (<a href="r.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>), How are a priori synthetic judgements possible?, or in other words, where do the concepts we employ to understand what we encounter in the world come from? We know Viveiros de Castro’s intentions match this Kantian ambition, otherwise he would not talk about decolonising thought, he would be more specific about his reference to the discipline of anthropology. Thought has historically been a process that, if it did not follow colonialist gestures as explicitly as anthropology has, it has at least been the benefactor of imperialism and the political apparatuses connected to it. The institutions of thought, those in the business of generating thought, the university, academia, presuppose a logic of extraction and accumulation which decolonisation entails the dismantling of. The irony of what Viveiros de Castro is suggesting is that the human science, what was once the spearhead of the colonising logic of thought, enacting the dehumanisation inherent in the extraction and accumulation of the human as object of thought, anthropology, will now be the source of a kind of redemption, where things come full circle. And the broadness of this vision entails a radical stance on the Kantian problematic. Where Kant laboured for a comprise between Newton and Leibnitz – a mutual involvement of the a priori and a posteriori in the generation of experience, transcendental idealism, where a priori rules that are the preconditions of experience (idealism) allow us to confront discoverable otherness (science, objectivity etc.), thereby unifying philosophy and science – anthropology cannot abide such an in-between stance. The reason for this is that the otherness anthropology has come to encounter, leads to a questioning of the validity of science. And the motivation presupposed in the entering into the problematic of the source of knowledge, unlike Kant, is normative and aware of a narrative nearing the end of its Karmic cycle. So here anthropology will simply pick a side in a way that will defuse the problematic entirely, anthropology will opt for perspectivism, a radical tolerance that gives everything over to the Other as the rightful owner of the originalities anthropology has historically taken credit for discovering. Kant’s transcendental idealism obviously did not resolve the problem in a satisfactory way for a great many thinkers and I have no interest in pursuing the validity of what Kant proposed here, but because Kant was looking to confront the tension between the two stances itself, he enabled a new space of the discussion to proceed. There is a violence to Kant’s first critique that stands separate from his racism, anthropocentrism, patriarchal and other flawed logics, which lies in his confrontation of the problem itself, head on, allowing it to stay a problem. While stepping away from the former violences anthropology has also abandoned the latter.</div>

<div>This is the anthropological image of the human we will be working with here. The anthropological question is a violent thing to do, to enter into a situation with other humans while the human itself is the problematic framing the encounter and the image generated by that discourse is the most fundamentally violent image. The violence of descriptions of violence or of a violent photograph is laide bare, it is how we frame our understanding of the situation but the anthropological image is violent in a more fundamental sense. It is not violent because violence is contained within the image, it is violent because it is an image. The imagness of the phenomeon is the violence.</div>
