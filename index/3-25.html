	<h3>3-27 Exploring Death in the Outer Wilds</h3>
		
<div>Outer Wilds (Beachum <a href="r.html#Beachum 2019" target="_blank" title="Beachum A (director) (2019) Outer wilds [videogame]">2019</a>), like many other indie games, is an exception to this and is particularly relevant to the present discussion because of the ways it is able to explore death and offer its own kind of redemption that is unique to gaming. In it, you explore a solar system of planets in your spaceship, discovering the remains and translating the texts of an ancient alien race. Through this process, you piece together how this civilisation came to your solar system and their extinction. After twenty-two minutes of exploring, the sun in your solar system goes supernova killing you and everything else with it. After this, the player is sent back in time to the beginning of the game to start over again. There is no form of combat in the game or enemies to fight, the only gameplay loop is to somehow solve the puzzle of the narrative. That is, find out why the sun is going supernova, how you keep getting sent back in time, and if there is a way to stop it and save yourself.</div>
		
<div>Despite the lack of violence, death is continually present and depicted in a number of ways. Player death is frequent, even besides the supernova that sends you back to the start of the game every twenty-two minutes. Because the game has no enemies, you always die due to some accident, peculiarity in the environment or naturally occurring phenomena. This often makes death feel somewhat meaningless, the result of chance in an indifferent universe. There is never any intentionality behind your death, no enemy to kill you, only your own mistakes and pure entropy. For example, you might forget to put your spacesuit on before exiting your spaceship or an island launched out of the atmosphere by a giant twister could collide with your spaceship. Player death is not the result of any conflict besides a very grand existential kind of conflict between you and the universe. While the play, die, repeat death mechanic is still very present here, that mechanic is being employed to express something about our fundamental situation as human beings. There is no avenging your death on a second playthrough, it just happened because death is part of living in this world.</div>
		
<div>This is the context in which you read texts from an ancient civilisation, who you find is also grappling with their place in an indifferent universe, seeking redemption therein. You learn of the tragic circumstances that left them stranded in this solar system, their failed attempts to discover the deepest secrets of the universe and how that curiosity and quest for redemption ironically led to their extinction. You read dialogues of them coming to terms with the finite nature of the universe:</div>
<blockquote class="small">This universe will keep getting colder and larger, until one day, the stars and the life they support will die. That’s scary to think about, even though Conoy tells me it won’t happen in our lifetimes. But it’ll happen in someone else’s, someday!</blockquote>
<div>It is a game about how life, even on a cosmic scale, is fundamentally finite and chaotic.</div>
		
<div>But that is only half of the experience the game offers, as this focus on death enables it to provide a kind of redemption that is both poignant and unique to videogames. Further, it is not the kind of redemption I referred to earlier that we find in many other videogames, notwithstanding the number of representations of death, that lean out of lived human experience. Outer Wilds offers a redemption that is not unlike what we see in The Brothers Karamazov (Dostoevsky <a href="r.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>) and it provides such in a way that is only possible through interactive media.</div>
		
<div>The aesthetics of the game plays a role here because Outer Wilds offers the player an opportunity to participate in depictions of creation in a way that points back to creation itself (once again, I am using ‘creation’ in the Rosenzweigian sense here). The game’s graphics are not aiming specifically at realism, but they are beautiful representations of things we see regularly, like the stars in the night sky. The ability to get in your spaceship, fly towards them, see the planets in motion, each eclipsing the sun in its turn seems to create a small version of ‘the overview effect’ described by astronauts who have looked down on the earth from space. Seeing the earth from such a vantage point elicits an emotional response and often a dramatic paradigm shift; one beholds ‘spaceship earth’. Death is everywhere in a universe that feels indifferent to human suffering, but the constant miracle of creation is ever present and affirming. Because this takes place within an interactive medium, the fact that you are activity discovering this beauty yourself makes this experience particularly affecting in a way that bleeds out into your everyday life. In this way, the game changes the way you think about and move within your everyday life and encourages you to embrace that which is redemptive in the game, namely exploration and discovery.</div>
