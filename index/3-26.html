	<h3>3-30 Redemption</h3>
		
<div>An epiphany that is available in Outer Wilds — for it can only be made available — is not unlike Alyosha’s in <em>The Brother’s Karamazov</em>. Rather than trying to make everything in the universe add up in a particular way, Alyosha accepts his participation in what is wrong with the world, he takes on something of that responsibility and this opens his eyes to the constant miracle before him:</div>
<blockquote class="small">Filled with rapture, his soul yearned for freedom, space, vastness. Over him the heavenly dome, full of quiet, shining stars, hung boundlessly. From the zenith to the horizon the still-dim Milky Way stretched its double strand. Night, fresh and quiet, almost unstirring, enveloped the earth. White towers and golden domes of the church gleamed in the sapphire sky. The luxuriant autumn flowers in the flowerbeds near the house had fallen asleep until morning. The silence of the earth seemed to merge with the silence of the heavens, the mystery of the earth touched the mystery of the stars… Alyosha stood gazing and suddenly, as if he had been cut down, threw himself to the earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="small">He did not know why he was embracing it, he did not try to understand why he longed so irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss all of it, but he was kissing it, weeping, sobbing, and watering it with his tears, and he vowed ecstatically to love it, to love it unto ages of ages. ‘Water the earth with the tears of your joy, and love those tears…’, rang in his soul. What was he weeping for? Oh, in his rapture he wept even for the stars that shone on him from the abyss, and ‘he  was not ashamed of his ecstasy’. It was as if threads from all those innumerable worlds of God all came together in his soul, and it was trembling all over, ‘touching other worlds’. He wanted to forgive everyone and for everything, and to ask forgiveness, oh not for himself! But for all and for everything, ‘as others are asking for me’, rang again in his soul. But with each moment he felt clearly and almost tangibly something as firm and immovable as this heavenly vault descend into his soul. Some sort of idea, as it were, was coming to reign in his mind — now for the whole of his life and unto ages of ages. He fell to the earth a weak youth and rose up a fighter, steadfast for the rest of his life, and he knew it and felt it suddenly, in that very moment of his ecstasy. Never, never in all his life would Alyosha forget that moment. ‘Someone visited my soul in that hour’, he would say afterwards, with firm belief in his words…</blockquote>
<blockquote class="small">Three days later he left the monastery, which was also in accordance with the words of the late elder, who had bidden him to ‘sojourn in the world’. (Dostoevsky <a href="r.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>:362-363)</blockquote>
<div>Of course, while Alyosha did not question his desire to kiss and love creation with all his heart, from that moment in the story the character does actively question and participate in the role he interprets to be his calling, that is to ‘sojourn in the world’. Not to transcend it or intellectually solve it somehow, but to participate in it, accepting his participating in the evil and actively trying to be that which is redeeming in the world, not seeking personal redemption but that of the worlds. This is the kind of thing you do as the player in <em>Outer Wilds</em>. In this way, it is not a game that holds your hand, it will never tell you what to do next. You, as the player, as the recipient of death and entropy in this world of chaos makes a choice to be a part of it, through the recognition of its value and beauty notwithstanding death. Doing so entails, like Alyosha, your own ‘sojourn in the world’ as you attempt to be part of the solution, leaning into your own participation and finding redemption in the same. That redemption comes through the process of learning more about the world by being in it, thus knowledge or learning is another one of the games major themes. Redemption comes via a particular type of learning, namely experiencing, and this is something videogames have the potential to address in ways that other mediums have not been able to. This redemptive experience, however, does not come from acting in a hyper-realistic rendition of the world we already know, it comes through game mechanics that highlight particularly human themes, saying something about what it means to be human, what it means to participate in the world, leaning into the human condition. I know of no other game that does this as effectively as <em>Outer Wilds</em>, but that does not mean it is alone — nothing about the game design is unprecedented, we have only been slow to recognise what videogames have to say about the anthropological question; ‘what is the human being?’.</div>
