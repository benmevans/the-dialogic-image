	<h3>3-31 Violence in Dialogue (c)</h3>
		
<div>On top of Deleuze (<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>) observation about things concealing their essence in their genesis, this has been due to what videogames are generally understood to be. Many people like to defend the artistic merit of the medium, advocating for an acknowledgement of creative expression on the level of films or literature. Of course, that the individual constituents of a game like the story, music or art is not disputed. The concern is whether a videogame as a whole should be culturally recognised and valued in the same way a classic film is. But in many ways, compared to these other ‘artistic’ mediums, a videogame is not a single experience, because everyone who plays the game will have a fundamentally different one. In this way, a game should not be regarded as a single work but as a dialogue that takes place between the player and the game designers. The game is designed with the player in mind, attempting to create a particular experience within a set of parameters. The player then responds to and acts within the system that is being presented to them. There is a degree to which the game designers have no control over what the player will choose to do and thus how the experience will be interpreted. Sometimes games are frustrating when the designer and player have misunderstood each other. Sometimes we find a way to play the game the designers did not anticipate, like, for example in speedruns. Videogames are a fundamentally interactive media and when you play a game you are participating in a kind of dialogue that has been anticipated by the game designers.</div>
		
<div>	As a kind of dialogue, games can be redeeming in ways that lean in or out of human experience. For example, a game world has the potential to saturate the player in a world of pure intentionality. By that, I mean that everything that happens in the three-dimensional world is deliberate and placed there for a reason. If I go outside my house and find a rock on the ground, no one put that rock there for me, it fell or rolled there somehow but the fact that its there has nothing to do with me — leaving aside the potential philosophical complications we could introduce here with idealism for now. In a game, however — and this is particularly evident in VR experiences — everything has been put there for me but some game designer. That is validating to me, I am the centre of that world. This might be one reason why videogames have been slow to provide redemptive experiences that lean into the human condition. There is already something inherently redemptive and validating about moving in a three-dimensional virtual space which is moving in the opposite direction. This makes experiences like what we see in Outer Wilds all the more remarkable, however, because the experience of intentionality is all still there. The game has obviously been designed around the player, and unlike some games with randomly generated worlds, it does not try to hide the fact that every aspect of the world has been meticulously placed in such a way so as to create a puzzle for you to solve. Not trying to hide it, is actually what allows the game to overcome the inherent aspects of the medium that lean out of lived experience. In this way, it embraces the fact that is is a dialogue and the redemptive experience of the game depends on this dialogic element. I was constantly curious to see what the writers and game designers would have to say about the universe as I uncovered the steps needed in order to reach the end of the game. The pursuit of a perfect simulation and perfect graphical realism can be associated with a similar ambition to hide the authorship of a videogame, as making such obvious would inevitably break the immersion. But redemption through immersion, or we could also call it escapism, is not only artistically boring; it says nothing about the human condition. If people want videogames to be taken more seriously, they should not be regarded as a work of art but as a conversation that takes place. A videogame is an invitation to take part in a dialogue, granted it is a profoundly limited and usually one-way dialogue, but a dialogue none the less. It is via this attribute that videogames are contributing and will continue to contribute to our understanding of the human and how being a human in the world is reconciled by many individuals.</div>
