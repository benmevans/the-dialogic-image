	<h3>3-33 A Creative Apology</h3>
		
<div>Unlike cinema or ethnography, in which the genius of the artform lies in overcoming the capturing and reductive gesture of the camera or method, videogames are open by default. We play a role in the generation of the violent image explicitly, but the image is always unresolved. There is no claim to totalisation, except for what videogames borrow from other media, because the image being generated always holds some potentiality, some secret, something incomprehensible that can only be revealed through its relation to the next image. And this next image can never be anticipated, even by the game developers, at least during gameplay. Even when a cutscene happens, what follows it is open and unresolved. A film can be an object that is static, it has completed its becoming and all it needs is a viewer. Of course, there are many possible interpretations of a film and in that sense, it is dynamic, but not so next to a videogame. A videogame is an event and violent images in videogames, though they can be just as reductive as any violent image when considered as an object, are acts of imaging. They are a process of the player orientating themselves in relation to the phenomenon of violence in the abstract sense.</div>
		
<div>This orientation can be limited because the event of a videogames is never entirely the players’. The gaze of the suffering other means that each party contributing to the event has an obligation to preserve and show reverence towards the And. I say ‘preserve’ because it is present in the fundamental gesture of videogames, as actions. Inasmuch as videogames have adopted techniques of capture from other mediums, they must also perform a creative apology. That is, the means of capture and representation needs to be problematized. But, of course, this is going to be taking place in a radically different way than other mediums, because those participating in the event that is videogames do not have the option of regarding the videogame as an object to be critiqued or made more complicated through historical positioning, and it cannot be placed next to other instances in the genre, in order to generate a kind of dialog between the cases. Many do this anyway, even perhaps while playing the game, but the moment they do, what is unique to videogames, what makes this phenomenon such a valuable contribution to our understanding of the human being, is no longer being referred to. Even in this essay, I have been analysing <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> as if it were a thing, but nothing about what I am doing here conveys even a part of what it is like to play the game. In videogames, the And must be preserved along the way by both players and developers. Developers must make the way available, but the complexity of violence can never be truly acknowledged by them alone. On the other hand, players can only go so far in the intentionality behind their actions to preserve something irreducible, to resist playing the game as an act of self-affirmation that kills any sense of otherness. In most videogames I have played, there is little space made for the jeopardising of our sense of self. Yet, in the beginning, in the days of Zork (Anderson et al. <a href="r.html#Anderson 1977" target="_blank" title="Anderson T, Blank M, Lebling D and Daniels B (1977) Zork [videogame]">1977</a>), this is all videogames were; again, this is the essential gesture of the medium.</div>
		
<div>There are an infinite number of ways to play any videogame and The <em>Last of Us Part II</em> is no exception. Beyond the particularities associated with how a player uses their hands to manipulate the image on the screen, how they push the buttons on the controller, this also encompasses everything players give to the videogame as an event, as a dialogic situation unfolding that they are only a part of. Many who played <em>Part II</em> have interpreted their experience as an orientation towards a nihilistic stance in relation to the world, or that the game’s message is hopelessness (see Tolbert <a href="r.html#Tolbert 2020" target="_blank" title="Tolbert S (3 July 2020) ‘The Last of Part 2’s ending is a broken tale of nihilistic indulgence’">2020</a>; Myers <a href="r.html#Myers 2020" target="_blank" title="Myers M (12 June 2020) ‘The Last of Us Part 2 review: We’re better than this’">2020</a>). This is what they understand Naughty Dog to be trying to do to them and is a reflection of the style by which the game was played. That is to say, Naughty Dog is not the sole author of the experience and these interpretations of the game, as a text, reflect those players contributions to the game’s becoming, perhaps more than anything else. Of course, the interpretation of a text always reveals something of the person doing the interpretation. So, what does this say about <em>Part II</em> as a videogame, beyond the fact that videogames have the potential to throw this feature of art criticism into relief?  Only that imaging violence is a shared responsibility, which neither those who are representing or those who encounter the representation can fully live up to on their own. For, in videogames it becomes obvious that we all participate in the process of representation – we all participate in that violence. But we can leave our images open, thus maintaining the irreducibility of violence, when images are no longer objects, but unresolved performances. This is something videogames, like <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, are teaching us how to do.</div>
		
<div>And the final cut-scene of the game encouraged my own awareness of this, when Ellie  says  to Joel – confronting him as the character who, we might say, represents the responsibility of every violent image produced in the series – to Joel, the personification violence: ‘I don’t think I can ever forgive you for that… but I’m willing to try’. The openness and unresolved nature of this statement is what enables the redemption of Ellie as a character. But she is also an invitation for how to perform the game, for there is always a ‘New Game’ to be selected in the menu, and there is always new meaning to be given to the next violent image we are working to produce.</div>
