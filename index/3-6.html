	<h3>3-8 What is Not Real Violence</h3>
		
<div>Computer generated images of violence are not equivalent to real violence and while this seems obvious, it is an important aspect of media to acknowledge. This can often be forgotten with the ease with which we speak of certain images as 'violent'. The image depicts violence, but it is not what violence is – at least not in the respect to which these descriptions are referring.</div>
		
<div>Carnagey et al. (<a href="r.html#Carnage 2007" target="_blank" title="Carnage NL, Anderson CA and Bushman BJ (2007) ‘The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to real-life violence’">2007</a>) mistake in the article titled, ‘The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to real-life violence’, was to assume that a video recording of violence equates to the actual phenomenon. As Alex Golub (<a href="r.html#Golub 2006" target="_blank" title="Golub A (28 July 2006) ‘Economists and anthropologists on video game violence’">2006</a>:para.4) noted, ‘there was no “real-life violence” in the study’, participants were only shown a ‘10-min videotape of real violence’ (Carnagey et al. <a href="r.html#Carnage 2007" target="_blank" title="Carnage NL, Anderson CA and Bushman BJ (2007) ‘The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to real-life violence’">2007</a>:492) after playing a violent videogame, and their response levels were measured. Rather than revealing the desensitizing effects of videogame violence this study reveals the researchers’ conflation of violent images and real-world violence. The researches’ anxiety regarding the image is built on the presupposition that the image conveys phenomena in a way that is equivalent to a lived experience of violence. Their error is rooted in a confused problematic, also identified by Welsh (<a href="r.html#Welsh 2016" target="_blank" title="Welsh TJ (2016) Mixed realism: videogames and the violence of fiction">2016</a>) in the first level of his book, Mixed Realism, which places the real and virtual in conflict, but leaves open the possibility the two being mistaken for each other.</div>

<div>Even more careful studies of videogame violence often participate in this conflation which is convenient to the criticism of the genre. This includes commentaries on videogame violence found in videogames themselves like in <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> (Davis and Coulon <a href="r.html#Davis 2012" target="_blank" title="Davis C and Coulon F (directors) (2012) Spec op: the line [videogame]">2012</a>). The game is a commentary of military shooters which draws attention to the player’s willingness to commit violent acts, but this is often accomplished by imbuing players actions with a false moral weight. </div>
		
<div>That is, by equating the production of violent images with real violence. A loading screen from the game, quoted by Keogh (<a href="r.html#Keogh 2012" target="_blank" title="Keogh B (2012) Killing is harmless: a critical reading of Spec Ops: the Line">2012</a>:8) reads: ‘To kill for yourself is murder. To kill for your government is heroic. To kill for entertainment is harmless’ (Davis and Coulon <a href="r.html#Davis 2012" target="_blank" title="Davis C and Coulon F (directors) (2012) Spec op: the line [videogame]">2012</a>). And Koegh is fulling willing to go along with the metaphysical and ethically reductive implications of this description of killing; ‘Of course we aren’t “actually” killing when we kill in a videogame. But after playing The Line, I‘m no longer sure the answer is that simple’ (Keogh <a href="r.html#Keogh 2012" target="_blank" title="Keogh B (2012) Killing is harmless: a critical reading of Spec Ops: the Line">2012</a>:8). But it should become that simple the moment we compare the act of killing in a videogame to the act of killing in real life – something Sontag’s (<a href="r.html#Sontag 2004" target="_blank" title="Sontag S (23 May 2004) ‘Regarding The Torture Of Others’">2004</a>:para.8) well-meaning declaration fails to leave space for: ‘the horror of what is shown in the photographs cannot be separated from the horror that the photographs were taken’. This is not to dismiss the event of violent images in videogames or any other context, only to say that we are dealing with something entirely different to the lived experience of violence, and that an effort must be made to maintain the distinction.</div>

<div>Of course, the image is real. Let us get to talking about what the image is and what is violent about it. Anyone who has experienced real violence or trauma in their life knows that dramatizations, rasterized animations or even actual recordings or photos do nothing to convey the lived experience of such events. To forget this is to reduce reality to the confines of a screen. Videogames and other visual media can point to real violence via what is irreducible in the artform, but what we see in the finite image, if anything, is something to be overcome in that regard.</div>
