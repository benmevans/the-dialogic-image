	<h2 align="center">4 CONCLUSION</h2>
	
	<h3>The Videogame Event as Simple</h3>
		
<div>We are reaching the limits of the term ‘real’ here, so I will perform a conceptual shift: when I say the act of playing a videogame is more real than any recording or description, I mean it is more simple. By this I mean, in an important sense, that the event in question is irreducible, ineffable and intellectually indomitable. This way of considering the event of playing videogames is in relation to, and opposed to, the complex involvements and baggage of images. I say the image is complex but the event itself is simple. This way of thinking, this allocation of the term simplicity, is detailed in Craig Dilworth’s (2013) book titled, Simplicity: A Meta-Metaphysics. There, over a hundred examples of simplicity are provided but the first three Dilworth (2013:14) describes are the self (‘understood in this way… [w]e cannot form a concept of the self’ but we take it to exist), the present (the present ‘exists in time without occupying time’) and cause itself (we understand specific examples of cause ‘but we cannot form a clear concept of cause itself’ – Hume’s ‘crux metaphysicorum’ [Kant 1783/2004:63] which, for Kant [1783/2004:10], ‘interrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave a completely different direction to my researches in the field of speculative philosophy’). When something is regarded as simple, further abstractions or accidents will make no contribution to our understanding of the concept, principle or category. Kant’s (1781/2007) noumena, Wittgenstein’s (1921/2014:89) ‘what we cannot speak about’ and Gabriel Marcel’s (1964/2002:55-56) meta-problematic, are thought of as simple in their respective philosophical systems or styles. Simplicity serves as a mysterious and apparently necessary limiting case: ‘I say that I think something is completely simple, only because I have really nothing to say of it than merely that it is something’ (Kant cited in Dilworth 2013:15). Simplicity is not an ontic or ontological claim but, somewhat like Laruelle’s (1996/2017) non-philosophy, is a way of thinking about and comparing different ways of thinking. It can be a framework for the democratizing process of generating and identifying new perspectives. (In a way, this is also what anthropology is, especially for people like Descola [2005/2013], Holbraad [2017], Kohn [2013], Viveiros de Castro, etc.).</div>
		
<div>In certain cases, like the videogame event we are concerned with here, we can describe something as simple because it is a transcendental principle of our thinking – transcendental in the Kantian sense, which pertains to the fundamental conditions of experience (Kant 1781/2007:A11-A12), but also more broadly, not necessarily in a philosophical context (Dilworth 2013:53). Here, in this study of the human, the videogame, as an event, is a condition of engagement in the same way writing or reading are conditions. In this sense it is transcendental. This project cannot problematise the existence of the videogame event because that event must be presupposed for the specific thinking we are engaged in as reader/writer; I am using the videogame to think, thinking with videogames and hopefully so can my reader. Thus, attributes like true/false or real/unreal cannot be applied to it in a straightforward way. I am not referring to the image, or the videogame as an object to be developed, distributed, sold, etc. I am referring to the actual human event, the unfolding and unpredictable dialogue that emerges whenever a videogame is played. Entering into that event is how I generated the following ideas. It is what I used to think. It is therefore transcendental or in other words, more broadly, it is simple. At lease, this is one way to think of the inter-human videogame event as simple.</div>
		
<div>This ‘simplicity way of thinking’ (Dilworth 2013:13) is applicable to any instance where fundamentals are being carefully considered. In mathematics we could describe Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem as simple and many anthropological concepts can easily be thought of in this way, like fieldwork, anti-structure (Turner 1967:125), liminality (van Gennep 1960), play (Caillois 1961/2001), deep play (Geertz 1973:432), ‘superrationalism’ (Lévi-Strauss 1955/2011:58) ‘ontology’ (Charbonnier 2017:167) etc. [BME1] This is not to suggest that nothing can be said about these ideas, only that, as estimations towards some element of the human condition, they can be thought of as simple. This is especially true if we compare the ideas and concepts listed above to the broader complex details and data which are employed by anthropologists to point to them.  As an image, this document is complex, like those specific images which have already been presented and described through gameplay footage and prose. This complexity will be leveraged to point towards the human event of a videogame as simple, that being something we cannot reduce into a representation without leaving a great deal, an infinity, of remainder.</div>
