<h2 align="center">4 CONCLUSION</h2>
		
<div>Concerning simplicity, Dilworth makes a further distinction between analytic simplicity and synthetic simplicity. He refers to this division as ‘The Second Level’. While I was researching and writing the early drafts of this document, I did not have simplicity, or this division, in mind; I had not yet encountered Dilworth’s book. But the project can nevertheless be drawn out, its structure can be described, according to analytic and synthetic simplicity. Throughout this work, I seek to point towards and draw attention to elements of the human event of videogames, which cannot be confined to an image, which are simple. We could say this happens in the following order: analytic, synthetic, synthetic, analytic. I will make the difference between analytic and synthetic simplicity apparent through a summery of this document, a description of this image.</div>
		
<div>The level after this one titled ‘The Videogame Event and Its Image’ identifies analytic simplicity in ‘real movement’, that is movement that cannot be quantified or reduced à la Bergson, in response to Deleuze’s identification of the same in cinema. This real movement is analytically simple because I take the broad phenomenon, that is our experience with the image, and locate therein some element which is irreducible and infinite, namely dialogue. The event of movement in videogames becomes an ‘unanalysable element’ (Dilworth 2013:24). Everything surrounding this fundamental element I regard to be complex. I describe that complexity in a way that directs us towards a central event, an in-betweenness, i.e. the result of players collaborating with developers to generate a spontaneous image. Via a brief interlude, I then explore the image itself, as a wholistic event, at first phenomenologically, to regard it as synthetically simple. I say it is synthetically simple, because the phenomenon of the image here is stretched out, broadened to encompass how the human experiences the image as an event. The event of the image in videogames becomes a ‘synthetic totality’ (Dilworth 2013:24). So, the level contains two perspectives, two ways of pointing towards the human event, as simple, around the phenomenon of a videogame. This is done by describing the image as complex in two different ways, pointing to the human event as both internally (analytically) and externally (synthetically) simple via a vis the image.</div>
		
<div>The final level titled, ‘Anthropology and the Violent Image’ begins with a construal of the image as synthetically simple. That is, as a broad reductive culmination of the infinite complexity of a violent event. Violence is ultimately described as a stillness here which is participated in or entered into by the player. A conceptual shift to analytic simplicity is then made through reflecting on my own participation in the production of violent images in videogames. An agency and spontaneity is then located within the event of the image. This unpredictability and caprice within the event of the image itself is drawn on to access a reading of redemption which is then applied not only to videogames but anthropology too. We have returned to analytic simplicity but this time in a way that is almost ethically motivated, while in the first level this began as a purely theoretical investigation attempting to apply some of Deleuze’s ideas to videogames.</div>
		
<div>So, the project here is to employ perspectives to frame the human in relation to the videogame, more than notwithstanding and in spite of the image, but via the image, which is all we have to work with. We can say this is accomplished by construing the image as complex in different ways to reveal how the human event we are concerned with is simple in different ways.</div>
