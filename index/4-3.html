<h2 align="center">4 CONCLUSION</h2>
		
<div>As has already been stated, I did not have Dilworth’s work in mind for the majority of the writing and research process. Simplicity is something that helped me at a later stage conceptualise the project for myself and I have attempted to convey that clarity to my reader at this early stage where it will advantage them the most. But this is not the only way to think about and structure the anthropological image that follows. One of the early impetuses for this project came from Deleuze’s work, particularly his cinema books. It was simply a curiosity, to see how Deleuze’s concepts about the cinema could be applied to more recent media like videogames and specifically virtual reality. This is why the next level opens with a comparison between cinema and videogames. And more than this starting point, the entire project can be framed around</div>
		
<div>The videogame event is first considered as Difference because I separate it out of the experience and it manifests itself as a source of violence, a spontaneous eruption which takes place in a dialogic event of a videogame. Then via a brief interlude the videogame event is conceived of as Repetition and the maintenance of a continues, impossible to enclose experience.</div>
		
<div>Then the violent image is experiences as repetition again, as an invalid encapsulation of something irreducible, violence is a stillness, which causes us to retreat into Difference again to articulate and salvage a kind of redemption.</div>
