	<h4>Cartesian Abstraction</h4>
			
<div>This is because the digital object presupposes a Cartesian abstraction which has already taken place. In order to think like Kittler (<a href="r.html#Kittler 1995" target="_blank" title="Kittler F (1995) ‘There is No Software’">1995</a>), one has to work backwards to undo the epistemological context that is thrust into our minds every time we look at a computer screen. This is why software, as an object, always leads to further abstraction, a more fundamental abstraction has already happened in order for the object to exist at all. McKeown (<a href="r.html#McKeown 2018" target="_blank" title="McKeown C (2018) ‘Playing with materiality: an agential-realist reading of SethBling’s Super Maria World code-injection’">2018</a>:1239) observed this in an exploration of code injection in Super Mario World:</div>
<blockquote class="small">Greater Knowledge of “the game” revealed that it was simply a series of instructions and activities that could be manipulated and distorted. Knowledge did not give rise to solidity but vaporiness.</blockquote>
<div>Thus, software becomes an elusive and strange object that defies classical instrumentation aligning with the empiricist tradition. The experience of software, as a digital object, can only exist for an abstract self, a user, that is treated as separate from it. However, even a superficial understanding of the phenomenon reveals its dependence on a specific human condition. When it comes to software, we are all Cartesians.</div>
			
<div>One response to this might be to question my specific association with Descartes (<a href="r.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) and the empiricist tradition he inspired. For example, this could be done with Bergson’s (<a href="r.html#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>:349) argument that, ‘Science is not… a human construction. It is prior to intellect, independent of it, veritably the generator of Things’. Thus, digital phenomena are only imitating a process that is fundamental to the human condition and there is no reason to specifically associate it with Descartes. Software is the performance of a more general human phenomenon which takes place every time a person reflects on the nature of things and perception in a general sense. Dipping in and out of this kind of awareness is what it means to be in the world. When we are in a task, we do not perform this abstraction. When we experience movement, we make no attempt to grasp it, for doing so destroys it, but we all still know what movement is. Thus, abstraction is an element of human nature that is more basic than Descartes’ ideas, however broad their influence. Why can software not then be attributed to an instance of this basic human inclination? It should be – in the same way Descartes’ philosophy is an enactment of it too. But Descartes is still part of a broader trajectory we need to appreciate to understand software as a human event. It is the way perception and the body are being played with here, in the phenomenon in question, that is at issue. It is the prioritization of utility and radical reflexivity resulting in a specific kind of abstract self that needs to be identified in software. We can do this by unmaking the digital object through its association with Cartesian philosophy.</div>
			
<div>Descartes (<a href="r.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) set the starting point within the intuition of thought and we have not left it. The creative evolution of software has been to give thought an object that it can become, or, rather, it is thought’s or the self’s struggle to turn itself into an object. As was explained above, though starting from the digital object resembles realism, it is to follow Descartes exactly. For, Descartes ‘was in intention a realist’ and software is a continuation of that trajectory (Gilson <a href="r.html#Gilson 1935" target="_blank" title="Gilson É (1935/2011) Methodical realism">1935/2011</a>:‘Methodical Realism’). Thus, software is an epistemological problem. It is not a mysterious thing to be understood but a way of knowing or stance the human has adopted towards the world. It is an instance of the human, a human event.</div>
			
<div>Software parallels Descartes’ (<a href="r.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) broader innovation to regard a process, namely the self, as an object. Descartes, the mathematician that he was, saw in those disciplines ‘which deal only with the very simplest and most general of things’, like arithmetic and geometry, that is, disciplines that can work with imagined objects, something beyond doubt. Though the wax is not perceived with the senses, in the ‘sweetness of the honey, or the fragrance of the flowers’ it is perceived nevertheless as ‘an inspection of the mind alone’ (Descartes <a href="r.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>). Then, everything becomes a question of process and one must no longer enquire into what a particular thing is, but the way it has been perceived by the mind. Descartes instigated a rationality that ‘is no longer defined substantively, in terms of the order of being, but rather procedurally, in terms of the standards by which we construct orders in science and life’ (Taylor <a href="r.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:156). Taylor draws a comparison between Plato’s model and Descartes’ innovation: ‘For Plato, to be rational we have to be right about the order of things. For Descartes rationality means thinking according to certain canons’ (Taylor <a href="r.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:156). With Descartes, the issue is no longer turning oneself towards the correct good, but the process by which one finds the good. The process itself is brought into question.</div>
			
<div>However, as Descartes (<a href="r.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) himself was keenly aware, it is not easy to consistently think in this way. Descartes (<a href="r.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>:23) reflects on how ‘a kind of laziness brings me back to what is more habitual in my life’, thus it is a process which must be seized and controlled:</div>
<blockquote class="small">My mind likes to wander and is not yet willing to stay within the boundaries of the truth. Let it be and allow it once again to be completely unconstrained so that soon afterwards, when the constraints are reimposed, it will find it easier to be directed. (Descartes <a href="r.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>:27)</blockquote>
<div>Thought itself has become the object to control and understand. Software, then, as a beneficiary of Descartes’ model, can be viewed as both a demonstration of the objectification of the process that is thought, as well as a means of expressing and accomplishing that instrumentation.</div>
