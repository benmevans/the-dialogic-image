	<h3>3-2 Christchurch</h3>

<div>This reality can abruptly enter our lives at any time, as it did for me in a relatively small way compared to those closer to it, upon learning of the terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, 15 March 2019. The news reports showed footage from the attacker’s live stream, moments before he killed 51 people (ABC News <a href="r.html#ABC News 2019" target="_blank" title="ABC News (3 May 2019) ‘Christchurch mosque attack death toll rises to 51 after man dies in hospital’">2019</a>). From a first-person perspective we saw the man drive and get out of his car, then approach the mosque with his gun visible. The perspective of the footage is significant, for it seems to demonstrate a truth which is easy to ignore about the horrors humans are capable of and one’s own potential as a human, that we share something with the terrorist as much as we would like to remove ourselves from him. Put another way, the first-person perspective invites you to imagine that you are the attacker.</div>

<div>The obvious reaction to this phenomenon is to distance ourselves from the man as much as possible: he is insane, a monster who I share nothing with. On the day of the shootings, New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern (<a href="r.html#Ardern 2019" target="_blank" title="Ardern J (15 March 2019), ‘Christchurch shootings mark “unprecedented act of violence”, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says’">2019</a>:para.6-8), expressed such a distance which also reinforced national identity and values,</div>
<blockquote class="small">Many of those who will have been directly affected by this shooting may be migrants to New Zealand, they may even be refugees here. They have chosen to make New Zealand their home and it is their home. They are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not. They have no place in New Zealand.</blockquote>
<div>But this recourse to national identity is not available to Australians who share their nationality with the terrorist. We must become separated from the evil being presented in a different way, by emphasising how incorrect the man’s beliefs about the world are and how far removed they are from our own. This is often extended to the point where one dehumanises the attacker, othering them as much as possible — ‘it was an inhuman act’, ‘he is a monster’.</div>
		
<div>However, I will argue that this approach is ultimately unsatisfactory and that there is no lasting redemption in our impulse to other human turpitude. I do not mean redemption for the man who killed those people, but for myself and for humanity generally, as ones who share and participate in a world where such atrocities are not only possible but frequent. As we work to push the intentions, ideas and the humanness of evildoers as far from our own identity as possible, the more repulsed we becomes with humanity generally, our entire situation and thus with oneself. While this kind of thinking is often motivated by deeply moral convictions, it ultimately leads to a philosophy like Ivan Karamazov’s. Not a disbelief in God or in a higher purpose necessarily, but a rejection of the world and an attempt to disavowal our participation in it. For Ivan, the suffering of a single child cannot be worth any end, no matter how glorious, so he wants to give back his ‘ticket’ (Dostoevsky <a href="r.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>:245). As he puts it to his brother, ‘would you agree to be the architect of such conditions?’ — the Christchurch shooting and innumerable other atrocities notwithstanding. But as Taylor (<a href="r.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:451) has explained, Ivan’s returning of the ticket,</div>
<blockquote class="small">is to close oneself off in a vicious circle. Rejecting the world seals one’s sense of its loathsomeness and of one’s own, insofar as one is a part of it.</blockquote>
<div>The kind of redemption I have in mind here would entail escaping this ‘vicious cycle’ completely.</div>
		
<div> In Ursula K. Le Guin’s (<a href="r.html#Le Guin 1973" target="_blank" title="Le Guin UK (1973) The wind’s twelve quarters">1973</a>:251-259) famous short story, ‘The Ones Who Walked Away from Omelas’, a utopia is described that is conditional on the suffering of a single child. I heard someone refer to this story at an anthropology seminar about asylum seekers on Manus Island. It occurred to me then that what people were interpreting to be the final moral of the story, to be ‘one who walks away from Omelas’, entails many of the same moral motivations as Ivan’s rejection of the world, as well as the same fundamental flaw. Many seemed deeply moved by the short description of the story notwithstanding, and I have to acknowledge the moral courage behind gestures like that in Le Guin’s story or Dostoevsky’s (<a href="r.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>) character Ivan. These rejections of the world are founded on the noblest of intentions. They are commendable and perhaps appropriate in certain contexts. However, they cannot be foundational to how we rationalise our position and participation in the world.</div>

<div>For, when such is applied so broadly, it slowly transforms from being self-righteousness to self-loathing and ultimately, as our three existentialists and Dostoevsky (<a href="r.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>) have each argued in their own ways, suicidal. That is how Rosenzweig (<a href="r.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:3-4) describes any philosophy that ‘takes upon itself to throw off the fear of all things earthly… [one that] can truly recommend only suicide, not the fated death for all’. Had Rosenzweig lived to witness the Second World War, it seems he would be been sympathetic to Marcel’s (<a href="r.html#Marcel 1950" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1950) The mystery of being: reflection and mystery">1950</a>:23) description of it:</div>
<blockquote class="small">We live today in a world at war with itself, and this state of world-war is being pushed so far that it runs the risk of ending in something that could properly be described as world-suicide.</blockquote>
<div>If pre-world war philosophies like Hegel’s (<a href="r.html#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>) are symptomatic of a condition which leads to mass death, the tragedy in Christchurch and others like it suggests we have not entirely grown out of those conditions. We are still clinging to the prospect of a transcendental enthusiasm like Buber’s (<a href="r.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2002</a>), to lift us out of the everyday anxieties of mortality towards something timeless and all encompassing. Though we express our flee from the world in a way that is philosophically and practically very different to Buber’s religious enthusiasm, we can still draw attention to the gesture. Philosophically in the domain of posthumanism, as it rejects the confines and terrifying implications of subjectivity, and practically in how we succumb to the immersive images being enabled by new and emerging technologies. Neither of these retreats from everyday-human-anxieties will come to terms with our participation in a world we find to be deeply flawed. Dostoevsky's (<a href="r.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>) characters who cannot meet this challenge ultimately destroy themselves and the lives of those they come into contact with. And this describes the condition we are behoved to seek a redemption from.</div>
