	<h4>Cogito Operating System</h4>
			
<div>This isolated self is an instance of radical reflexivity, for it is being separated, even from itself and becoming an object for itself. The building of an OS is a process of separation through abstraction; the user and machine are being teased apart through the automation of computer resource distribution. A culmination of this process of separation is the creation of a user account. Very few people use their computer solely in root because it is dangerous. One might accidentally delete or alter an essential file. Users need to be separated from sensitive files with passwords and individual log-ins. Even if only one person will ever use a computer, they still need an account with distinct permissions and changing how the computer works requires users to go into root or use ‘sudoers’.  Thus, the human is an enemy to the complex functioning of a computer and a barrier of sorts needs to be constructed to preserve smooth operation. The GUI and user accounts are manifestations of this necessary separation. This is a performance of the separation Descartes (<a href="r.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) presents in <em>Meditations</em>, which results in a self which is distinct and separate from the entire world of sense.</div>
			
<div>In this way, the computer not only speaks to a user, it frames a cogito. Software cannot exist without it and all objects on screen are the event of the user participating in the process of making themselves and construing thought as an object. Software, as an event, is the process of framing a specific type of self. It both presupposes and enacts a cogito oriented towards utility. Writing code does not make software or digital objects, but is a process of Cartesian abstraction, which for a user has already taken place.</div>
			
<div>This generation of a sense of self is taking place any time we use a computer. <em>Arch Linux</em> is a useful example because in it we can see the intentional carving out of a self that the designing of an operating system entails. But this does not mean it applies any less to more popular operating systems like <em>Windows</em> or <em>MacOS</em>. The user boots up the machine as a user, skipping over some of the process of abstraction but there is still the initial instance of describing oneself, which establishes a distinct relationship with the computer.  The user puts their name, region, language, privacy settings etc., not to create some digital version of themselves, but to create a self, district from the machine, so that the machine can be instrumentalized, but also distinct from themselves so they can instrumentalize thought. It is a gesture of control, a gesture of instrumentalization in the most radical sense. Even when there is no explicit user account, everything moving on the screen, the dialogue that is taking place, presupposes an individual orientated towards utility. This is true if the user is using a computer on the surface level or writing code to change how software performs. The colour of the icon is not in the icon itself but the code, which can be controlled by an abstract self. This instrumentalization is valued as an essential element of the self, which connects to self-expression, disciple and control. The premise of all software is the empowerment of the user as agent via a Cartesian objectification of thought.</div>
			
<div>There is conflict surrounding what constitutes empowerment, but empowerment itself, as a value, is never brought into question. The Free Software Foundation champions a very specific conception of user empowerment that hinges on the user’s unlimited access to the source code. But this is not a concern for most people, who do not know, and are not interested in, what to do with the source code if it were given to them. Indeed, for many users, too many options actually inhibit their freedom and they are left feeling disempowered. Regardless, there is a consensus surrounding an ethics that is centred on control. To deprive a human of that control is to withhold some fundamental right.</div>
			
<div>And here we can identify some of the sources of <em>Arch Linux</em> rhetoric. For, while the wiki describes <em>Arch</em> as ‘a pragmatic distribution rather than an ideological one’ (Arch Linux <a href="r.html#Arch Linux 2021" target="_blank" title="Arch Linux (16 July 2021) Arch linux wiki">2021</a>:Pragmatism), the whole appeal of Arch, and GNU/Linux distributions like it, is that the user, to varying extents, builds or customizes it themselves. This aligns perfectly with the moral values often associated with empiricist traditions we associate with Descartes (<a href="r.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) and also Locke. For Locke (cited in Taylor <a href="r.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:167), ‘The floating of other Mens Opinions in our brains makes us not a jot more knowing, though they happen to be true’ , and there is likewise less value in a software when the user plays no role in its becoming. Just as the ideas of someone else do not really belong to me until I have gone through the necessary mental procedures to validate it for myself, a pragmatic approach to software should facilitate the user’s apprehension and control of software in the most fundamental way. This also aligns with the Free Software Foundation’s imperative, which is to enable users to use software rather than be used and controlled by it.</div>
