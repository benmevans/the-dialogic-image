	<h4>Emacs</h4>
			
<div><em>Emacs</em> is the epitome of Stallman’s (<a href="r.html#Stallman 2019" target="_blank" title="Stallman R (2019) 'Linux and the GNU system'">2019</a>) vision of what free software that respects its users ought to be. Science fiction author, Neil Stephenson (<a href="r.html#Stephenson 1999" target="_blank" title="Stephenson N (1999/2007) In the Beginning… Was the Command Line">1999/2007</a>:‘OS Shock’), describes it this way:</div>
<blockquote class="small">I use emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear word processor… the engineer-hours that, in the case of Microsoft Word, were devoted to features like mail merge, and the ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate memoranda, were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively simple-seeming problem of editing text.</blockquote>
<div>The prospective <em>Emacs</em> user should be forgiven for wondering what is lacking in this most basic of computer tasks. For the average user does not meet a great deal of resistance when they set out to put words on the screen. <em>Emacs</em> will make this resistance a reality with a steep learning curve and with the promise of greater freedom on the other side. The program is well equipped to deal with writing complex bodies of text, for its main use is as a text editor for writing code. Much of this, as Neil Stephenson and many other writers have found, translates well to the task of writing prose more generally. This is described as a process of learning how to use the software and this description turns on the notion of the good empowered human who is in control, who can seize an object and make what they want out of it, even when that object is themselves. That is, the user must make themselves in order to take control of the software. Learning how to use Emacs is a process of self-development.</div>
			
<div>This will become clearer if we detail the typical movements that take place in Emacs as an emerging human event. <em>Emacs</em> is presented as a text editor designed for writing code, discrete for its customizability and extensibility. This is the appeal that might lead someone to participate in the evolving human event that is the software.  Like all the <em>GNU</em> tools, <em>Emacs</em> represents an attempt to undermine the typical power structures inherent in software between developer and user. This is accomplished by demanding a great deal from the user. The software environment necessitates a high level of competence and to use <em>Emacs</em> effectively, the user must construct a workflow by editing config files, assigning and memorizing numerous key bindings and coming to terms with the design logic that has governed <em>Emacs’</em> development since its inception. This logic moves on the premise of expanding utility and explains why, at this stage, <em>Emacs</em> can be used to do almost anything from planning a project to surfing the internet or playing games. None of these possibilities, however, will be evident to the new user.</div>
			
<div>If someone downloads the software with the intention of using it for creative or academic writing (as many do), it is likely that they will feel profoundly confused and powerless when they first open the program. After seeing a page that says, ‘Welcome to GNU Emacs’, the user might be left wondering why there is no option to create a new document, or what a ‘buffer’ is. When they finally get a blank screen to type words on, they might feel a profound absence of customisation options and conclude the promised empowerment of Emacs is a lie.  Eventually they decide to read the manual, learn about major and minor modes, that for their purposes they need to switch to ‘org mode’ and start reading an entirely separate manual specific to that mode. Simple things that are normally taken for granted in a word processor, like the cursor automatically moving to a new line, might take an entire afternoon to resolve (this was my experience), especially if one is unpractised in stating the problem in the language of <em>Emacs</em>.</div>
			
<div>The user is transformed through their participation in the event that is the software. Their comprehension and appreciation of the power of Emacs is proportional to their becoming with it, indeed this should be regarded as an arbitrary distinction.  Emacs is an act of framing a particular kind of Lockian self that is disciplined and self-developed. I say it is Lockian because of the way Locke (<a href="r.html#Locke 1689" target="_blank" title="Locke J (1689/2001) An Essay Concerning Human Understanding">1689/2001</a>) pushed Descartes’ (<a href="r.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) disengagement further to the point of self-remaking. For Locke (cited in Taylor <a href="r.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:170), the will is entirely determined by an ‘uneasiness of desire’. That is, our actions are reactions to the greatest discomfort and educating ourselves according to correct cannons can ‘change our pleasures, and give us a relish to what is necessary’ (Locke cited in Taylor <a href="r.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:171). There are necessary growing pains associated with learning Emacs, but the user will eventually come to enjoy and value these initial inconveniences as essential. The user comes to appreciate the utility of <em>Emacs</em>. It is not just about learning how to use the software but learning to want to do what is possible with it. In this way, software is a preestablished map for the possibilities of thought. Coming to terms with those possibilities entails the making of a new self, one that can more fully participate in the inter-human event that is the software.</div>
