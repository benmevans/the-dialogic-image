	<h2>Software and the Problem with Digital Objects</h2>

	<h3>Free Software and <em>GNU/Limux</em></h3>
			
<div>Since software has been distributed and sold as a finite commodity, the Free Software Foundation has fought to protect user’s rights in relation to it. Their ethical stance is connected to a more general construal of software which regards it as a special type of object. On their website they explain:</div>
<blockquote class="small">Software differs from material objects — such as chairs, sandwiches, and gasoline — in that it can be copied and changed much more easily. These facilities are why software is useful; we believe a program's users should be free to take advantage of them, not solely its developer. <span class="reference">(Free Software Foundation <a href="r.html#Free Software Foundation 2018a" target="_blank" title="Free Software Foundation (2018a) 'Philosophy of the GNU project'">2018a</a>:para.3)</span></blockquote>
<div>This understanding of software as a digital object is foundational to their human rights project, which is founded on utility. The user must be able to ‘take advantage’ of the properties that make software unique. Software is a thing to be manipulated, to have control over, and like any tool it must be ‘useful’. Anything less than complete access to and control over the source code, prevents instrumentation. Proprietary restrictions obstruct the user’s ability to make software an object for them, to penetrate it, comprehend it and change how it works. In a mechanistic understanding of the universe, every object can and ought to be understood and controlled, including software. Thus, ‘free software’ refers to user agency; it is, ‘…a matter of liberty, not price’ <span class="reference">(Free Software Foundation <a href="r.html#Free Software Foundation 2018b" target="_blank" title="Free Software Foundation (2018b) 'What is free software?'">2018b</a>, para. 3)</span>. Such is the basis of the Free Software Foundation’s ethical and moral stance in relation to software.</div>
			
<div>This stance both emerges from and motivates an intimate knowledge of software and a competence in its manipulation. Those responsible for the Free Software Foundation, particularly Richard Stallman, display these traits in the various achievements attached to the organisation. The most notable of these is <em>GNU/Linux</em>.</div>

<div>The <em>GNU</em> project started in 1983 with Stallman’s <span class="reference">(1983 cited in Williams <a href="r.html#Williams 2012" target="_blank" title="Williams S (2010) Free as in freedom (2.0): Richard Stallman and the free software revolution">2010</a>:89)</span> announcement:</div>
			
	<blockquote class="small">Starting this Thanksgiving I am going to write a complete Unix-compatible software called GNU (for Gnu’s not Unix), and give it away for free to everyone who can use it.</blockquote>
				
<div>By 1991 Stallman and other contributors had developed and released much of a complete operating system (OS), apart from a working kernel <span class="reference">(Smith <a href="r.html#Smith 2012" target="_blank" title="Smith RW (2012) Linux essentials">2012</a>:8)</span>. Linus Torvalds' <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Torvalds 1991" target="_blank" title="Torvalds (developer) (1993) Linux [software]">1991</a>)</span> <em>Unix</em> <span class="reference">(Thompson et al. <a href="r.html#Thompson 1973" target="_blank" title="Thompson K, Ritchie D, Kernighan B, McIlroy D and Ossanna J (developers) (1973) Unix [software]">1973</a>)</span> compatible <em>Linux</em> kernel was combined with the <em>GNU</em> tools to create <em>GNU/Linux</em>, a fully functioning OS capable of replacing <em>Windows</em> <span class="reference">(Microsoft <a href="r.html#Microsoft 1985" target="_blank" title="Microsoft (developer) (1985) Windows [software]">1985</a>)</span> or <em>MacOS</em> <span class="reference">(Apple <a href="r.html#Apple 2001" target="_blank" title="Apple (developer) (2001) macOS (software)">2001</a>)</span> <span class="reference">(Stallman <a href="r.html#Stallman 2019" target="_blank" title="Stallman R (2019) 'Linux and the GNU system'">2019</a>:para.5)</span>. <em>GNU/Linux</em> is also capable of meeting every criterion outlined above for ‘free software’, though this will depend on which distribution has been installed and whether the user has opted to download proprietary drivers.<em>Arch Linux</em> <span class="reference">(Polyak <a href="r.html#Polyak 2002" target="_blank" title="Polyak L (lead developer) (2002) Arch linux [software]">2002</a>)</span> is one distribution which is growing in popularity for its enactment of the utilitarian values outlined above and I will be returning to it later in this interlude.</div>

<div><em>GNU/Linux</em> has become the platform of choice for many users on two grounds, which converge. The first is utility. Many find <em>GNU/Linux</em>, and other software associated with it like <em>Emacs</em> <span class="reference">(Moon and Steele <a href="r.html#Moon 1976" target="_blank" title="Moon DA and Steele Jr. GL (original authors) (1976) Emacs">1976</a>)</span>, to be more powerful. There are seemingly infinite levels of customisation all the way down to the OS kernel, if one has the knowledge and ambition. GNU/Linux is the epitome of what Chun <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Chun 2008" target="_blank" title="—— (2008) ‘On Sourcery, or Code as Fetish’">2008</a>:300)</span> describes as ‘the valorization of the user as agent’. This connects to the second ground, namely ethics. Free software means ‘users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software’ <span class="reference">(Free Software Foundation <a href="r.html#Free Software Foundation 2018b" target="_blank" title="Free Software Foundation (2018b) 'What is free software?'">2018b</a>:para.3)</span>. All these become possible in <em>GNU/Linux</em> while in <em>Windows</em> <span class="reference">(Microsoft <a href="r.html#Microsoft 1985" target="_blank" title="Microsoft (developer) (1985) Windows [software]">1985</a>)</span> and <em>MacOS</em> <span class="reference">(Apple <a href="r.html#Apple 2001" target="_blank" title="Apple (developer) (2001) macOS (software)">2001</a>)</span> often almost none of them are. Both grounds are tied to an epistemological stance, which I will trace to Descartes <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>)</span> and which places the good within a process of disengagement and control. Good productive humans are in control of their environment and of themselves. For this to be realised, one needs access to the bottom of things, i.e. the source code. It must be a possibility for the user to know everything constituting the object in question — to have these paths open is both good and practical.</div>
