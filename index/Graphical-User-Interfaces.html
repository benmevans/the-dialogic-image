	<h4>Graphical User Interfaces</h4>

<div>It is easy to attribute this construal of software – that is to regard it as a special type of object – as something inherent to graphical user interfaces (GUIs), stepping over the epistemological conditions that frame it entirely. That a list of commands can be made visible and graphically represented on a screen as a potentiality, the same way a sandwich sitting on the table is a potentiality, contributes to how quickly most of us accept a description of the pictures on a monitor as 'objects'. 'These objects... can be made visible or invisible through the configuration of the system' (Hui <a href="r.html#Hui 2016" target="_blank" title="Hui Y (2016) On the existence of digital objects">2016</a>:1), popping in and out of existence as virtual lines or pathways. These paths are described and marketed to the user as physical objects, as metaphors, so they are immediately understood. The ‘desktop’ is where I arrange the items I am currently working on; the ‘file system’ is where my ‘documents’ are stored. And this is all a very natural and understandable way of describing how computers work, one that developers and programmers comply with and are largely responsible for, e.g. the founding <em>Unix</em> (Thompson et al. <a href="r.html#Thompson 1973" target="_blank" title="Thompson K, Ritchie D, Kernighan B, McIlroy D and Ossanna J (developers) (1973) Unix [software]">1973</a>) idea that ‘everything is a file’ or object-oriented programming. Metaphors aside, if we were not so accustomed to GUIs it would be less obvious to describe a string of commands as a ‘digital object’.</div>
			
<div>Thus, the obvious explanation for the direction of OS development, as it has moved from the command line to the desktop environment or GUI, is that software has been made to resemble the way we already interact with physical objects. Computers have become visual because the way humans have evolved to interact with their environment is based on visual cues. It is easier for a person to deal with a complex list of commands, if those commands are represented on a monitor as an icon with a name. This is to ‘hide a whole machine from its users’ (Kittler <a href="r.html#Kittler 1995" target="_blank" title="Kittler F (1995) ‘There is No Software’">1995</a>:para.12) in a way that has become fundamental to how computers operate, and not even <em>GNU/Linux</em> has been able to escape this act of deception. For the software must be usable for the neophyte and this is accomplished through a GUI. When proprietary software does not close users off from parts of their machine, lack of knowledge and the sheer convenience of graphical interfaces will.</div>
			
<div>But all this only points to the type of object software is, ignoring what it means for software to be regarded as an object in the first place. We know there is something more behind the ‘images pulsing from the screen’ (Chun <a href="r.html#Chun 2006" target="_blank" title="Chun WHK (2006) Control and freedom: power and paranoia in the age of fiber optics">2006</a>:4), for digital objects behave in a fundamentally different way to their physical counterparts. So, we have all gotten very used to thinking with metaphors. An object does not have to be physical to be ‘real’ and making this point in the context of computers has been one of Boellstorff’s (<a href="r.html#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>; <a href="r.html#Boellstorff 2014" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2014) ‘An afterward in four binarisms’">2014</a>; <a href="r.html#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>) priorities. But there is an obviousness to this that makes it almost unnecessary. Things like money, as Boellstorff (<a href="r.html#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:387) notes, or even the words I am writing now must be real in some sense. Kittler (<a href="r.html#Kittler 1995" target="_blank" title="Kittler F (1995) ‘There is No Software’">1995</a>) was one of the few with a commitment to realism strong enough to reject this in his influential essay, ‘There is No Software’, but we need to move the discussion away from the realist/nominalist dilemmas. This is because regardless of where an author locates themselves on that spectrum, they always start from the digital object and make an attempt to grasp it.</div>
