	<h3>3-3 Redemption (a)</h3>

<div>It is possible to construe the distancing and rejection of the world just described as a kind of redemption in itself — I am being broad here and will only describe it as a general direction. This direction might entail, like Ivan Karamazov, returning one’s ticket (like relinquishing our biases towards anthropocentrism), or it could mean something profoundly spiritual and escapist. Regardless, rather than leaning into lived experience these stances seek to get beyond it somehow, be it morally, spiritually or philosophically. It is a cathartic diversion to insist the injustices of the world will never add up, that they do not need to or that God will somehow make them all add up in the end.</div>
		
<div>While a more standard way to separate reactions to death and suffering is to consider those who believe in a higher purpose and those who do not, here I am getting at an entirely different distinction. There are atheists, theists and polytheists who lean into the experience of death and those who lean out of it. The atheist leaning out elevates their moral dispositions to condemn creation, while the theist might reject the world on the basis of original sin. I say all this because it is important to separate what I am doing from notions of religious belief or the spiritual. It is not a matter of belief but of coping. I say they are ‘leanings’ because it seems unlikely for anyone to complete a trajectory in or out of lived experience, thus they are mere directions.</div>

<div>Dostoevsky (<a href="r.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>), the existentialist that he was, and unlike his character, Ivan, always leaned into the experience of suffering and death in his fiction. Much of this was, no doubt, inspired by a number of dramatic life experiences where leaning out, finding solace beyond this life, seemed unavailable. In 1849, Dostoevsky was sentenced to death for belonging to a secret utopian society before his sentence was changed at the last minute. In a letter to his brother he wrote:</div>
<blockquote class="small">Then three of us were set against the posts so as to carry out the execution. We were summoned in threes; consequently I was in the second group, and there was not more than a minute left to live. I remembered you, my brother, and all yours; at the last minute you, you alone, were in my mind, and it was only then that I realized how much I love you, my dearest brother! I also succeeded in embracing Pleshcheyeve and Durov, who were beside me, and bade farewell to them. Finally the retreat was sounded, those who had been tied up to the posts were led back, and they read to us that His Imperial Majesty granted us our lives. Thereupon followed the actual sentence…</blockquote>
<blockquote class="small">Brother, I am not depressed and haven’t lost spirit. Life everywhere is life, life is in ourselves and not in the external. There will be people near me, and to be a human being among human beings, and remain one forever, no matter what misfortunes befall, not to become depressed and not to falter — this is what life is, herein lies the task. (Dostoevsky cited in Pevear <a href="r.html#Pevear 2004" target="_blank" title="Pevear R (2004), ‘Introduction’">2004</a>:xii)</blockquote>
<div>During and after this close encounter with death, Dostoevsky found redemption in the present experience of being ‘a human being among other human beings’ (Dostoevsky cited by Pevear <a href="r.html#Pevear 2004" target="_blank" title="Pevear R (2004), ‘Introduction’">2004</a>:xii), reflecting on the love he had for his brother and embracing his friends.</div>
		
<div>It was perhaps the above experience that set Dostoevsky (<a href="r.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>) on a trajectory to explore the themes of redemption in <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>. There is no better way to present Dostoevsky’s argument than the narrative provided in the book, but Taylor (<a href="r.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>) effectively summarises its argument this way:</div>
<blockquote class="small">What will transform us is an ability to love the world and ourselves, to see it as good in spite of the wrong. But this will only come to us if we accept being part of it, and that means accepting responsibility. Just as ‘no one is to blame’ is the slogan of the materialist revolutionaries, so ‘we are all to blame’ is of Dostoevsky’s healing figures. Loving the world and ourselves is in a sense a miracle, in face of all the evil and degradation that it and we contain. But the miracle comes on us if we accept being part of it. Involved in this is our acceptance of love from others. We become capable of love through being loved…</blockquote>
<div>This accepting responsibility for the evils of the world entails a shouldering of universal guilt. The character Dimitri maintains that he did not murder his father, but by the end of the book acknowledges that he wanted to and thus participated in the same evil responsible for his father’s death. In the story, we see how this acceptance of guilt can open someone up to accept love from others which in turn leads to a love and gratitude for the world or what Rosenzweig (<a href="r.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>) would describe as a continual process of creation.</div>
		
<div>I have never killed anyone, but I have been angry before; I have never shot anyone, but I have shot a gun before; I have never shot people before, but I have seen a point of view similar to the one in Christchurch with a gun floating at the bottom of the screen while playing a videogame and I did shoot people. This is a radical leaning into the evil of the world, acknowledging oneself as a participant in the perpetuation of suffering and death.</div>
		
<div>The description of Dostoevsky’s (<a href="r.html#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>) redemption that I have provided here is incomplete because it is inescapably tied, as I have already mentioned, to the narrative of The Brothers Karamazov. Fiction and other kinds of art can offer a unique kind of redemption that is able to point back to experience itself. They offer a silent explanation that is unique to the person, which can often be especially clear by virtue of the fact that it does not try to get behind anything like a metaphysical system and neither does it abandon life’s most precious components to a sea of entropy. Art does not try to get under experience, it lifts it up in a way that is redeeming. It points to creation, not the traditional seven-day biblical creation, but the Rosenzweigian notion of creation as a continual process. The universe is ever renewed, it keeps saying ‘yes’, that is the primordial yes of existence, and within that yes is a no and the no says, ‘not otherwise’ (Rosenzweig <a href="r.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:27-28). Notwithstanding one’s own limitations and shortcomings and one’s broken participation in that yes, the ever-enduring base of things continues its resounding ‘not otherwise’ and hidden therein is the ‘yes’ of creation (Rosenzweig <a href="r.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>). Art has a way of directing us back towards our participation in creation, the acceptance of which allows us to find beauty and redemption within our everyday lives.</div>
