<h2 align="center">3 VIOLENCE: THE VIDEOGAME EVENT</h2>
	
	<h3 id="3-1">3-1 Three Existentialists</h3>

<div>Rosenzweig’s (<a href="r.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>) magnum opus, <em>The Star of Redemption</em>, opens with a critique of Western philosophy’s efforts to transcend death. He argues that philosophical systems like Hegel’s (<a href="r.html#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>) fail to account for an individual’s fear of mortality, such singularities are abandoned in the ultimate cognition of the All; ‘Why should philosophy be concerned if the fear of death knows nothing of such a dichotomy between body and soul, if it roars Me! Me! Me! … for all this dire necessity philosophy has only its vacuous smile’ (Rosenzweig <a href="r.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:3). Rosenzweig’s subsequent existentialism offers redemption from death by incorporating it into the system he builds throughout the book; the text opens with ‘from death’ and ends with the words ‘into life’. Rather than a conclusion, Rosenzweig later points to ‘into life’ as an invitation to verify the central motifs of the work, namely love, language and the name, ‘in the course of everyday life’ (Rosenzweig cited in Glatzer <a href="r.html#Glatzer 1985" target="_blank" title="Glatzer NN (1985), ‘Forward’">1985</a>:xviii). The baggage and subjectivity of the individual become foundational and a source of insight instead of something to be overcome.</div>
		
<div>This is how Rosenzweig (<a href="r.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>) associates philosophy’s attitude towards death with its quest to avoid all presuppositions. For, to acknowledge the terror one experiences before the imperceptible void of death is hardly a neutral vantage point from which to explore philosophical questions. Yet for many — especially Rosenzweig, serving in an anti-aircraft unit during the First World War, writing these words on a small military postcard (Pollock <a href="r.html#Pollock 2019" target="_blank" title="Pollock B (29 January 2019), ‘Franz Rosenzweig’">2019</a>:para.2) — daily life is framed ‘over the grave which yawns at our feet with every step’ (Rosenzweig <a href="r.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:3). The philosopher has no right to assume a more elevated position.</div>
		
<div>Rosenzweig (<a href="r.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>) is not alone in the way he grounds his philosophy through the frame of mortality, especially among other philosophers often associated with his strand of existentialism. Death is an essential theme in the writings of Marcel (<a href="r.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:72) who noted that, ‘Certain readers will be surprised at the role played by death, suicide, betrayal, in all of my writings’. For him, these themes were indispensable;</div>
<blockquote class="small">I do not think we can ever ascribe enough importance to these, and any philosophy which tries to elude them or conjure them away, is guilty of the worst possible kind of betrayal. (Marcel <a href="r.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:72)</blockquote>
<div>The ‘betrayal’ Marcel is referring to aligns his reasons for focusing on death with Rosenzweig’s. Both authors associate the acknowledgement of the lived experience of death with an acceptance of presuppositions. Throughout <em>Creative Fidelity</em>, Marcel (<a href="r.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:4) resists any ‘claims to install himself at the centre of being’. This commitment to lived experience was demonstrated in the way Marcel presented his ideas and explored concepts in his plays and metaphysical journals (see Marcel <a href="r.html#Marcel 1949" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1949) Being and having">1949</a>; <a href="r.html#Marcel 2007" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (2007) A path to peace: fresh hope for the world: dramatic explorations">2007</a>). His thought commences from lived experience and, after exploring concepts within, points the reader back towards the same. Marcel shares this final invitation with Rosenzweig, though he differs in his determination to remain within lived experience itself, hence his sometimes preferred format of a daily journal, reflecting on his own death and the role it is playing on the development of his thought (Marcel <a href="r.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:12).</div>
		
<div>Buber (<a href="r.html#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2002</a>:16) shares an anecdote in <em>Between Man and Man</em> which demonstrates how everyday life and the impact of death contributed to his own thought:</div>
<blockquote class="small">What happened was no more than that one forenoon, after a morning of ‘religious’ enthusiasm, I had a visit from an unknown young man, without being there in spirit. I certainly did not fail to let the meeting be friendly, I did not treat him any more remissly than all his contemporaries who were in the habit of seeking me out about this time of day as an oracle that is ready to listen to reason. I conversed attentively and openly with him—only I omitted to guess the questions which he did not put. Later, not long after, I learned from one of his friends—he himself was no longer alive—the essential content of these questions; I learned that he had come to me not casually, but borne by destiny, not for a chat but for a decision. He had come to me, he had come in this hour. What do we expect when we are in despair and yet go to a man? Surely a presence by means of which we are told that nevertheless there is meaning.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="small">Since then I have given up the ‘religious’ which is nothing but the exception, extraction, exaltation, ecstasy; or it has given me up.</blockquote>
<div>We can assume that this experience was foundational for Buber in the development of his thought. I anticipate that some will regard it to be so, solely on the grounds of it being an instance of his conversion out of the religious enthusiasm that he previously embraced. But I share it here to highlight how Buber’s subsequent philosophical anthropology is grounded in everyday interpersonal acts of dialogue. The young man’s death, in the story, awoke Buber to the illegitimacy of a division separating, not only the temporal and spiritual life, but a distinct vantage point in philosophy from which the whole can be circumscribed. Buber’s philosophical anthropology is similar to Rosenzweig (<a href="r.html#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>) and Marcel’s (<a href="r.html#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>) thought because it embraces the subjective human perspective, which includes a fear of death. Indeed, it was through the regret Buber felt in the above story, when the reality of death entered his life, that he was brought down to the everyday.</div>
