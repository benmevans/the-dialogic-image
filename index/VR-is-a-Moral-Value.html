	<h4>VR is a Moral Value</h4>
			
<div>This cost might be a disillusionment, a moral fragmentation described by Alasdair MacIntyre (<a href="r.html#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>) or temporal disorientation conveyed in Löwith’s (<a href="r.html#Löwith 1957" target="_blank" title="Löwith K (1957) Meaning in history: the theological implications of the philosophy of history">1957</a>) work – the ‘malaise of modernity’ (Taylor <a href="r.html#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>:299). MacIntyre (<a href="r.html#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>:111) paints the modern moral landscape as an assembly of morals and ideals from disparate sources that are fundamentally incompatible. Enlightenment projects embraced many aspects of Aristotelian ethics while rejecting the teleological contexts they emerged from. Just as King Kamehameha II was able to abolish taboos without resistance in Hawaii because they were no longer couched in a context that gave them meaning, MacIntyre (<a href="r.html#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>:111) calls Nietzsche (<a href="r.html#Nietzsche 1882" target="_blank" title="Nietzsche F (1882/2008) The gay science">1882/2008</a>) the ‘King Kamehameha II of the European tradition’:</div>
<blockquote class="small">For it was Nietzsche's historic achievement to understand more clearly than any other philosopher… not only that what purported to be appeals to objectivity were in fact expressions of subjective will, but also the nature of the problems that this posed for moral philosophy. (MacIntyre <a href="r.html#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>:113)</blockquote>
<div>Enlightenment ethics, like Kant’s (<a href="r.html#Kant 1785" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1785/2002) Groundwork for the metaphysics of morals">1785/2002</a>) moral philosophy, which says we must always treat people as ends in themselves and never as a means, can only be naively upheld in a Weberian bureaucratic context of emotivism. Because Weber (<a href="r.html#Weber 1905" target="_blank" title="Weber M (1905/2001) The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">2001</a>) finds all values to be equally non-rational, the responsibility is then placed on the individual to simply choose. However, there is no system in place to determine how those values ought to be deduced, save only, in many cases, the capitalist mechanism of bureaucracy. But these systems hardly fulfil Kant’s (<a href="r.html#Kant 1785" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1785/2002) Groundwork for the metaphysics of morals">1785/2002</a>) categorical imperative to not treat people as means and subjectivism prevents any values from being universally applied. The moral foundations of any modern bureaucratic culture contain ‘suppressed Nietzschean premises’ (MacIntyre<a href="r.html#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>:114) and Weber’s description of values was no exception (MacIntyre <a href="r.html#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>:26). In a moral landscape like the one Nietzsche recognised, absent of any real objectivity the Ubermensch becomes the new imperative, we must become ‘human beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves’ (Nietzsche <a href="r.html#Nietzsche 1882" target="_blank" title="Nietzsche F (1882/2008) The gay science">1882/2008</a>:189).</div>
			
<div>We should recognise this Nietzschean value in the philosophy behind VR. Crawford (<a href="r.html#Crawford 2015" target="_blank" title="Crawford MB (2015) 'Virtual reality as moral ideal'">2015</a>:32) associates virtual reality broadly with Kant’s (<a href="r.html#Kant 1785" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1785/2002) Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals">1785/2002</a>) moral philosophy in the way virtual technology is designed to liberate Reason from whatever might be obstructing it in physical reality. But VR often betrays this value, for as it strives to be a technology that enables the clearest expression of our wills the means by which this is accomplished entails an objectification of the individual, through both capitalist consumer contexts and also through the way VR seeks to manipulate and control human perception. In this way, it is more accurate to associate VR with Nietzsche’s (<a href="r.html#Nietzsche 1882" target="_blank" title="Nietzsche F (1882/2008) The gay science">1882/2008</a>) moral philosophy or at least the ‘suppressed Nietzschean premises’ MacIntyre (<a href="r.html#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>) has identified in bureaucratic enterprises generally. There is a dissonance between the ideals sought for and the means by which they are achieved in the VR industry.</div>
			
<div>This has some implications for VR in the way it is strived for as a utopian ideal. Our society still holds to a particular kind of eschatology that is embedded in the institutions of modern science, though this is not essential to any scientific method based on observation and hypothetico-deductive reasoning. Scientific methods depend on an unknown and a lack of resolution and this is something Kant (<a href="r.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>) reinforced in his metaphysics. Just as Kant (<a href="r.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>) describes, this dependency has not discouraged many scientific aspirations (as we see in the ‘Transcendental Dialectic’; Kant <a href="r.html#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>:285-549), nor has it discouraged the actioning of an eschatology through scientific means; this is what VR is.</div>
			
<div>We can see these aspirations visibly being demonstrated in rhetoric pertaining to a virtual utopia, a future of humanity that has fully overcome all resistance pertinent to the human condition. Löwith (<a href="r.html#Löwith 1957" target="_blank" title="Löwith K (1957) Meaning in history: the theological implications of the philosophy of history">1957</a>) presented a Heideggerian style historical analyses of the history of the philosophy of history, working his way backward from Burckhardt (<a href="r.html#Burckhardt 1943" target="_blank" title="Burckhardt J (1943) Refections on history">1943</a>) to the <em>Bible</em> to reveal the eschatological roots of Western philosophy’s conception of History. This can also be identified in Western projections of the future and VR emerges and finds value as a demonstration of that trajectory. Like many technologies, VR reinforces a narrative of progress. Beyond demonstrating a particular set of beliefs about reality, VR demonstrates the approach of an ideal that is based on the moral premises of Western culture. Though, as MacIntyre (<a href="r.html#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>) has demonstrated, these premises are deeply flawed, they are ‘fragmented’ in a way that constitutes the peculiar conditions of secular pluralism.</div>
			
<div>Part of Taylor’s (<a href="r.html#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>) thesis is that there is something fundamentally disorientating about secular pluralism, the unprecedented coexistence of irreconcilable worldviews. We can view VR as a technology that has emerged out of and in response to these conditions, it is the ultimate liberation of the individual physically, mentally and morally. Morally, not just in the way VR enables individuals to perform violent acts or virtual sex without consequence – these aspirations are present but not central to the culture of VR enthusiasts I am currently aware of – morally, in the way these deeply inform our conceptions of self. Hence, Taylor (<a href="r.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:4) uses the term, ‘strong evaluations’ to convey a broader moral picture that extends beyond questions of right and wrong and into questions regarding what constitutes a good life, what is worthy of praise beyond aesthetics, ‘a moral reaction is an assent to, an affirmation of, a given ontology of the human’ (Taylor <a href="r.html#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:5). When the question of morals is viewed more broadly in this way, it is easy to see how VR entails a very clear picture of these ‘strong evaluations’. They are thrown into relief because the whole point of VR is to provide an escape to an ideal which people have of human existence.</div>
			
<div>It must be acknowledged that most instances of VR have value because they are not real. If a shooting game felt too real, for example, the experience would lose value and the user would become terrified and experience the same kind of trauma as real war. But these examples might only demonstrate the dissonance present in our moral condition, an inconsistency in the things we are reaching for and in what positively reinforces our sense of self. VR seems to reveal inconsistencies in the way it is an elaborate accommodation for them.</div>
