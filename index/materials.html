	How to Read This Document</h3> 
		
<div>I call this document an image. It is an image on my monitor, as I write and manipulated it through software. It is an image for my reader — the image on your screen.</div> 
		
<div>This image is the byproduct of a dialogue between myself and the developers of the various software I used to produce it, namely <em>Microsoft Word</em> (Microsoft <a href="#Microsoft 1983" target="_blank" title="Microsoft (developer) Microsoft word [software]">1983</a>), <em>Scrivener</em> (Blout <a href="#Blout 2007" target="_blank" title="Blout K (original author) (2007) Scrivener [software]">2007</a>), <em>EMACS</em> (Moon and Steele <a href="#Moon 1976" target="_blank" title="Moon DA and Steele Jr. GL (original authors) (1976) Emacs">1976</a>), <em>Adobe Dreamweaver</em> (Adobe <a href="#Adobe 1997" target="_blank" title="Adobe (1997) Adobe dreamweaver [software]">1997</a>) and finally <em>Notepad++</em> (Ho <a href="#Ho 2003" target="_blank" title="Ho D (developer) (2003) Notepad++ [software]">2003</a>). I do not mean that I spoke with the developers of these computer programs in person or on <em>Zoom</em>. The software itself is a dialogic event, which now involves my reader; it has always been this.</div>   
		
<div>It was even dialogic when I tried to write without using any software at all, which is how I wrote the first drafts of the sections about <em>Street Fighter</em>. I drafted them in grey lead pencil on loose leaf paper in the dark corners of the Deakin University, Burwood Campus, Library Scholars’ Room. They were later scanned onto a computer using the library’s scanner, and I copied them into a digital image of coded text like the one you are reading now. Here is an image of a sample of that early draft:</div>

</figure>

<div>Because this essay is about digital images, and because it was produced as a digital image, it ought to be read as one – notwithstanding that singular instance about <em>Street Fighter</em> where some ideas were generated without a computer being present at the time. And there are more reasons for this than the author’s pedantic desire for consistency through topic and reader experience – I ought to be grateful for any time given regardless of the context. This image cannot be experienced on a printed page. It can only be read and viewed with a computer, mouse in hand or, swiping thumb at the ready. For, this image is interactive, as I will now partially explain.</div>

<div>In traditional anthropology, the ethnographer might spend a day with informants conducting participant observations. At the end of the day, they return to where they are staying, pull out a typewriter, and in this way, generate an image, richer than any camera could capture, of the day’s proceedings. The anthropologist interested in videogames has a different relationship to the phenomena which are to be represented, described and thought with, because the human event in question is already an image. These images can be captured and recorded perfectly and easily. For some, this might mean 'an elaborate venture in... "thick description"' (Geertz <a href="#Geertz 1973" target="_blank" title="Geertz C (1973) The interpretation of cultures: selected essays">1973</a>:6) in videogames, has no thickness to describe, esspecially for the videogame image itself – we already have all the pixels. The videogame image is already an image, a representation of the human to be ignored in favour of more compelling human assemblages like online virtual worlds in social media. But here is the first of the many reasons why I will say that the opposite of this is true: if we can take those recordings of gameplay - those finite images disabling anthropological concern - if we make them constituents of the project itself we will see them necessitate a real anthropological contribution to our understanding of the videogame event. Because an image is already there, we are behoved to think in new ways, to find a way to contribute something more than the recording, not necessarily to <em>thicken</em> it but to find new ways into the image itself, to frame it as a human event, to generate a new anthropological image.</div>

<div>I have embedded images, short videos of the videogames in question, into this document. They should be played in the instances where they occur in the text. The ideas being discussed and these perfect (in one sense) portrayals of the events in question are suspended together in a collage. This allows for something more to be present in the image and prose together, through a kind of relationality, which would otherwise be impossible.</div>

<div>By playing each of the videos, this reader/user/viewer/player is producing an image which has not happened yet, collaboratively, with me. This is in the same way I produced the videos throughout, collaboratively with the developers of the videogames that are presented. And I have produced <em>this</em> image – as I said at the beginning – collaboratively with the developers of software I used to write it. Here is a screenshot from the same section as <a href="#Figure 1" target="_blank" title="Early draft">Figure 1</a>, as I see it now in <em>Notepad++</em>:</div>

1 INTRODUCTION</strong></h2>

	<h3 id="1.1"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
1.1</a> A New Anthropological Image</h3>
		
<div>To play a videogame, a person concentrates their attention on a panel of flashing lights while holding a controller or while resting their hands on a table, over a mouse and keyboard. There needs to have been at least one developer, which is the person who has anticipated this, the player’s posture. Between the player and developer, we can isolate two more elements: hardware and additional software. Concerning hardware, we might describe what its design and commodification contribute to the event in question. With additional software – e.g. the operating system, game engine, drivers, etc. – the event becomes more cumbersome to represent and analyse. This is because each software instance, once considered, creates a new developer vis-à-vis player situation. A multitude of people – development teams with directors, designers, artists, programmers, etc. – are usually involved and manifest in the image. They have anticipated and responded to this labour performed by the player or user. In this way, each choreographed and automated computer process that is necessary for the gaming event to occur forms an overwhelmingly complex and genealogical matrix. A complete description of this mere experience – picks up the controller, ‘I’m going to play some <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> (Gavin et al. <a href="#Gavin 1996" target="_blank" title="Gavin A, Rubin J, Siller D, Zembillas C and Pearson J (creators) (1996) Crash Bandicoot [videogame]">1996</a>)’ – entails a detailed history of computing, untangling the authorship of layers of code from binary to a ‘custom LISP dialect’ (Gavin <a href="#Gavin 2011" target="_blank" title="Gavin A (25 October 2011) ‘Lispings ala John McCarthy’">2011</a>:para.3), directed entirely at the conveyance of a singular image, with all its particularities – that time I defeated Dr. Neo Cortex.</div>

<div>This project will only fulfil a part of what I have just described, but there are other ways to regard the human event that is a videogame. I will demonstrate some of these presently. I call these specific descriptions or representations of the human being <em>images</em> in the same way I have described this entire document to be an image.</div>
		
<div>Our first type of human image is the most obvious and the first one we experience, often before playing a game – to behold it is like being yelled at. I have embedded examples of these images throughout the document.  Their emergence is ubiquitous across videogames as a medium; they are what videogames look like. They are pixelated, rasterized or ray-traced images of human (humanoid) characters killing, dying, solving problems, jumping, suffering, eating food, copulating, defecating, etc. (this list is in order of prevalence, from <em>ad nauseum</em> to strange novelty). This human image can be reproduced in the document, distinct from gameplay.</div>

	<figcaption class="small"><a href="#RFigure 2" target="_blank" title="Full citations for captured footage (new tab)">Figure 2</a>: Images of humans in videogames</figcaption>
</figure>

<div>We can distinguish another type of human image which is less obvious. This image can demand a great deal from those who participate in its emergence, that is, from those who participate in the event which generates it. It is not immediately given and the spectacle of the first image, as is shown in the above gameplay footage in <a href="#Figure 2" title="Figure 2: Images of humans in videogames" target="_blank">Figure 2</a>, creates resistance for the second’s actualisation. The second image takes work to pull out and convey to ourselves or others. The first image evinces the representation/capture of a human while the second evinces a thought event in relation to the human. Put differently, beyond the above visual images of people doing things, we can <em>think with</em> videogames to generate images of <em>the</em> human or humanity. This can be done in reference to specific instances; I will provide three examples.</div>
	<ol>		
		<li><em>Street Fighter V</em> (Nakayama <a href="#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>) gives us an image of the possibilities of human coordination and anatomy through the input commands of special moves, e.g. <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/582165470?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" target="_blank">Ryu's Shoryuken</a>. This human image emerges from thinking about game mechanics and input commands.</li>
		<br>
		<li>The story of <em>The Last of Us</em> (Straley and Druckmann <a href="#Straley 2013" target="_blank" title="Straley B and Druckmann N (directors) (2013) The last of us [videogame]">2013</a>) performs a reversal of Christian atonement and eschatology to probe the problem of evil and human suffering. This human image is identified in narrative and themes.</li>
		<br>
		<li><em>Spelunky 2’s</em> (Yu <a href="#Yu 2020" target="_blank" title="Yu D (director) (2020) Spelunky 2 [videogame]">2020</a>) randomly generated levels force players to cope with systems, rather than scripted spaces, generating a Kantian image of human knowledge where ‘receptivity can make knowledge possible only when combined with spontaneity’ (Kant <a href="#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>:A97-A98). This human image comes out of a creative association between Kant’s (<a href="#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>:121-169) 'Transcendental Deduction' and <em>Spelunky 2</em>.</li>
	</ol>
<div>We can also be less specific by posing the question of the human to videogames in general. The gamer might be a bricoleur where ‘… the rule of his game is always to make do with “whatever is at hand”’ (Lévi–Strauss <a href="#Lévi–Strauss 1962" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1962/2021) Wild thought: a new translation of la pensée sauvage">1962/2021</a>:21) or videogames might expand the possibilities of our sense of self, extending the ‘horizon within which I am capable of taking a stand’ (Taylor <a href="#Taylor 1998" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:27). And all these are to show how we might generate novel ways of considering humanity via the videogame, for each instance of a videogame can be made to speak to the question of human possibility and the phenomenon of videogames as a whole represents a human striving for new possibility spaces.</div>

<div>This second type of videogame image – which I just demonstrated in the above theoretical extensions of the videogame towards an image of the human or humanity – these are of another order relative to the loud and stimulating human images of the first type in <a href="#Figure 2" title="Figure 2: Images of humans in videogames" target="_blank">Figure 2</a>. My examples of the first type are images I generated through playing videogames. I recorded the footage using this HDMI video capture card, which I purchased on eBay for $15.95.</div>
<figure>
	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/6XGnYx3/capturecard.jpg" alt="capturecard" border="0" class="center">
	<figcaption class="small">Figure 3: HDMI Video Capture card</figcaption>
	</figure>
<div>This device constitutes a unique anthropological and ethnographic opportunity, an unprecedented technique ‘for the representation of social and cultural life’ (Marcus <a href="#Marcus 1986" target="_blank" title="Marcus GE (1986) ‘Afterword: Ethnographic Writing and Anthropological Careers’, in Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography">1986</a>:264) only possible in videogames, as will be shown. My examples of the second type are images I generated later, after the fact, play, dialogue, capture, question and creative contemplation of the first type, in reference to the human condition. Beyond playing videogames, I generated these second images as ideas and associations to demonstrate the portrayal of what could be called a second-order human image, i.e. the fruition (image) of a thought event that emerges from an image event (the image event being a videogame or videogames).</div>

<div>Videogames entail and make possible certain styles of thought, unique to the phenomenon as a becoming with other human agents. In the same way, anthropology can be said to tend towards its own unique ways of thinking and dialogue. And anthropology entails an image of the human, i.e. the ethnography, which is radically different from what is presented in videogames. Nevertheless, both entail the performance of an image event. I have made an effort throughout this document not to favour an anthropological image or way of thinking over the videogame, as a seperate and unique mode of orienting us in relation to the human. Like anthropology, videogames are to think and perform an image of the human.</div>

<div>I have called this document an image and here, at this early stage, it is appropriate to state exactly what it is an image of. It is both an image of the videogame and the human (an anthropological image) to the same extent. Because I will argue the videogame to be a human event, it is not inaccurate to say, more simply, that this document is an image of the human.  But the videogame will require and inspire us to find new ways of doing anthropology, which is why I say it is a new anthropological image.</div>

<h3 id="1.2"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
1.2</a> Three Ways</h3>

<div>I will explain this project three times: twice in a small way and once in a big way (this entire document is the big way). These explanations can be thought of as three performances or image events.  More than an introduction, body and conclusion, I give my reader three separate images of the same human event. All three explanations are mere attempts at pointing to events, and all do not succeed in capturing the whole of those events to the same extent, in a way that is infinite. But they are also all events in themselves, as performances of writing, reading, playing and watching. Each explanation moves from the former orientation pertaining to the performance’s (and other events which constitute an image) failure to capture the videogame event, to the latter orientation, which pertains to the performance as an irreducible event in itself. I will now perform my intention for this project, in the first instance of what I have called a ‘small way’ (the big way has already started).</div>

1.3</a> The Videogame as Human Event (a)</h3>

<div>All the images described in the first section of this level can be viewed as reductions of an event; none of them perfectly convey the experience of what it is like to play a videogame, to participate in the videogame image. If our objective is a perfect conveyance of the human videogame experience, it would be better for my reader to simply play a videogame and not read any further. This is an essential distinction for what follows. So far, we have seen how there are multiple ways of construing a human image of (or with) the videogame in addition to the videogame image, as a human image itself. There are multiple ways of performing the reduction. Each one pushes into relief different elements of the event; some are obvious while others take effort and creativity. Videogames draw attention to the inadequacy of all these images as aftermaths of an irreducible event. Anyone who has played a videogame before can feel the non-performance of that frame by frame reproduction of events produced by my HDMI video capture card. While playing a videogame the image as an object, notwithstanding its dazzling and essential nature, is always subordinate to the event of the image. Playing a videogame means regarding the image as an event. In this way, videogames are the apotheosis of a new orientation the human is assuming in relation to images; the image is an event, it is what we do, it is not a thing to be described, it is that which describes, I become with the image – the transcendental image.</div>

<div>The image is, then, not a thing to be understood in different ways – from one perspective it is an object, from another it is an event – rather, different ways of thinking, positions or orientations will regard different events to be their image. The image is dynamic and signals a way of thinking, like how memories, projections and fantasies each involve different styles of thought, styles that precede their image and not the other way around. Descartes’ (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) philosophy frames our experience of the world as a series of images we receive via our sensory organs, but here experience comprises of images because of the way Descartes has thought about said experience. This way of thinking is not how we usually orient ourselves in relation to the events of daily life. If I see someone fall off their bike, I move to see if they are okay and regard myself as part of that transpiring event – I do not consider it to be an image. The Cartesian image entails a particular way of thinking which separates me from the event – I establish a distance through the abstraction (construction) of an isolated sense of self, distinct from <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/582174637?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" target="_blank">the suffering other who fell off their bike.</a></div>

<div>But videogames constitute a different perspective; to play a videogame entails a forgetting of the image as a separate thing to be looked at. We enter into a becoming with the image as an event. In this way, to approach videogames with anthropological concerns (videogames as human events, not objects) involves the conveyance of the image as an event – making the realism and spectacle of the image as an object recede in our descriptions, corresponding and in response to the way it recedes while, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/5JSIyrVONmM?t=291" target="_blank">battling Satsuki</a> in <em>Demon’s Souls</em> (Moore <a href="#Moore 2020" target="_blank" title="Moore G (director) (2020) Demon’s souls [videogame]">2020</a>). We can find a new perspective, a new plane of human possibility, by regarding the image to be an event, a process of thinking, an epistemological stance, a videogame. This description of events connected to the image, the constituents of the image as a human experience, is what I will do here – I got the idea from playing videogames.</div>

<div id="1.3p4">This process of description can start by distinguishing the events which make up an image. These include (1) consuming an image, (2) producing an image and (3) the event that an image is of. These each still treat the image as an object in relation to some human process but remember this is only our starting point. Their more detailed description, the boiling down of what is actually going on in the phenomenon will reveal how these events, each taken in isolation, treat the image to be one of the other events. For example, when I am consuming an image, I regard the image, the thing I am beholding, to be either how the image was or is being produced or whatever the image is of. When you are in the process of producing an image, by ‘I am making this image’ you mean you are creating some user/viewer experience or that you are capturing the likeness of some event which is more than your process can capture (the event that an image is of). Finally, while we are concerned with the event that an image is of we are either not thinking about the image at all, or we are contrasting the image with the event it represents.</div>

<div>This is what I meant above when I said that what constitutes an image will depend on our position or the event we are currently engaged in. When the events constituting the image of each perspective are described, the image is revealed to be a collection of events. We will also find that, producing the image, consuming the image and the event that an image is of are not mutually exclusive, that they are in many ways equivalent and that the third event, whatever the image is of (which can also encompass the first two) is more, infinitely more, than whatever we could mean by ‘this image’. The videogame forces these three events to coalesce, for the videogame event is always all three at once in the moment we are playing a videogame, and this is what makes the videogame a special human event.</div>

<div>The act of gameplay invites us to think in different terms, on the videogame’s terms, which can redeem our participation in image events. This is not so because we have made things more complicated by describing the image in greater detail. Getting underneath the image event in that way alone only performs another reduction, generates another image, namely an image of the events of an image. Rather, the reduction event I described as being intrinsic to the image (that which I accused the image of in the <a href="#1.3" title="1.3 The Videogame Event (a)" target="_blank">first paragraph of this section</a>) is reframed as a particular stance of feigned non-participation, not playing a videogame, not producing an image by consuming it, not consuming an image by producing it, making the image be of some event it should not be. The videogame image, the act of playing a videogame, in the performing of a <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> (Motomura <a href="#Motomura 2018" target="_blank" title="Motomura J (director) (2018) Dragon Ball FighterZ [videogame]">2018</a>) <a href="https://youtu.be/x2ZMEWtBc6s?t=42" target="_blank">combo string</a>, there is no external event or object to be reduced. Image production, consumption and the event that an image is of, become a single performance or human event. The reduction event, as an act of orienting ourselves in relation to ‘that image’, an otherness reduced to finitude, is never the end product. It happens along the way into the event of the videogame image itself. In response to that orientation we say something like, <em>this is not over</em>. The performance of reduction is redeemed (unreflectively, retrospectively, potentially) within the creative and dialogic act of the videogame image event, which we, as participants (players), are a part of.</div>

<div>And by ‘redeemed’ here I mean we have justified the image event as a transcendental condition of engagement. The performance of an image (not necessarily a videogame image) is how we will reorient ourselves vis-à-vis the otherness we have failed to represent. Further, we are behoved to continue to correct our failed representations; we need to keep playing the game. We have some responsibility, bestowed by the haunting and incomprehensible otherness we experience through the set of events we regard as an image. For example, I have described this text as an image which is a signification of my stance as its author. I, as author, am not in a position to redeem this document from its failings to accurately represent what I have set out to describe. But the act of reading can be regarded as a creative event in the same way my act of writing is. The instance of reading is where I must hope <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em> can be redeemed, as an event. We read texts and participate in images in new ways, we extend them as dialogic events, in order to redeem them; we condemn them hypocritically by framing a static image.</div>

<div>And this is how far we will get in this document – that was a small way of performing what I hope to achieve here. The image, as a set of events, will not be described sufficiently for the gesture of this entire document until much later, until the various events which make up the image have been explored and described along a trajectory. The upshot of that trajectory occurs towards the end of the <a href="#3" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">third level</a>. I will now anticipate some elements of the experience of that level for my reader, to the extent that those elements are relevant to these early stages of the document and for my reader’s bearing of the whole.</div>

1.4</a> In Anticipation of '<a href="#3" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">Violence: The Videogame Event</a>' Which Concerns the Event that an Image is Of</h3>
		
<div>The third level titled ‘<a href="#3" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">Violence: The Videogame Event</a>’ is to redeem the image event in response to the line of thought to which that level is dedicated, where the image emerges in its most problematic state as a kind of violence. This framing comes out of an exploration of the events which constitute a videogame image, performed in the level before it, <a href="#2" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image" target="_blank">'Dialogue: The Videogame Image'</a>. Here is a fast way into what this third and culminating level will do, though the actual level will take the long route, viz. the entire document up to that point: abstracting the image into events invites a number of distinctions to be made: the difference between the image being conveyed through prose and the act of playing a videogame, between what is being displayed on the screen and the act of playing a videogame, between an image and the event that an image is of, between a rasterized image of someone being shot in the head, an image of an actor pretending to be shot in the head, an image that is a recording of someone being shot in the head and someone being shot in the head.</div>

		<figcaption class="small"><a href="#RFigure 4" target="_blank" title="Full citation for captured footage (new tab)">Figure 4</a>: Two violent images (rasterized and filmed)</figcaption>
	</figure>

<div>We can regard my performance of an image of a man being shot in the head with <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> (Druckmann et al. <a href="#Druckmann 2020" target="_blank" title="Druckmann N, Newman A and Margenau K (directors) (2020) The last of us part ii [videogame]">2020</a>), as less violent because of its proximity to the footage of Nguyễn Văn Lém's execution. The historical footage of an actual event of violence makes that rasterized and pretended violence of the videogame image seem fake and trivial. This is one way to think of it, and it is the way I thought things would go before I edited the above video. However, now that it is here, my experience of this image is unexpected, though I can only speak for myself. I played a larger role in the making of this image than my reader, so I am differently oriented, which might be why I see the influence these images have on each other in the reverse. That is, the image of an execution I performed in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is <em>not</em> made to feel less real as a result of its juxtaposition to the footage of Nguyễn Văn Lém. <em>The Last of Us Part II's</em> violence could not be made less real for me. At no stage during my playing of the game, or watching or editing the recording, did I assume a real execution was transpiring or had transpired in reference to that image of Ellie shooting an NPC (non-player character). Rather, <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> brings the captured war footage into alignment with it, as another mere image, another futile attempt at conveying the termination (or explosion) of otherness that occurs when a bullet passes through someone's brain. Being in a position to manipulate the image, feeling the burden of being someone who produces the violent image (as one is while playing a videogame), changes our orientation towards the image. The image is then of the process we went through to produce it more than it is of the event it is supposed to represent. <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> has more colour and detail, but we, as viewers, bring different contexts to how we experience the image. The Vietnam footage is more violent because we know it really happened, that Nguyễn Văn Lém and Major General Nguyễn Ngọc Loan were real people. But if we are explicitly producing the image and are aware of our contributions to it, we do not put faith in the concealed movements of a camera, we know where the image came from, and that any image can only point towards some irreducible human event, which it cannot encompass. Someone passes in front of the camera, just as Nguyễn Ngọc Loan pulls the trigger, we have only this angle, we have only this many frames, this resolution, such distance, the list goes on forever; we have everything there is to work with, we can slow things down or zoom in, insert a more realistic gunshot sound, add ambience, place it next to some other image and see how that changes our experience, we tailor an experience. To make the image of the begging NPC, I killed all his friends then shot him in the hand to disarm him - that's when they start to beg - and I made that image of violence just for the sake of this paragraph and to experience and contrast rasterization and film in a single violent image. The association established in that video works to invalidate the associating of either image with a violent event. Both images fail to represent real violence. We might have already known this in reference to the videogame image, but now the historical image is there too; I put it in the video.</div>         
<div><a href="#3" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">'Violence: The Videogame Event'</a> will express a concern for the image’s failings in this regard, irrespective of the image's source (videogame, camera or otherwise), namely the image's universal failure to encompass the irreducible event of violence. The event that is the experience of the image (consumption) and the event which generates the image (production) will have been dealt with earlier for their own sakes in the <a href="#2" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image" target="_blank">second level</a>. In this <a href="#3" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">third level</a>, we will address the image’s claims that it is of some event beyond the image, specifically violence. In this way, the violent event that an image is of can be thought of as the object of the image’s intrusion and that which the image occludes. The violent image – as something to behold, as a concept – is the performance or participation in an event that reduces and hides the event of suffering otherness through the process of production and consumption, the event/s of the image. I disassociate the violent image from the violent event, via videogames, in response to this hostile gesture. This allows the violent image to be framed as a dynamic event for us, rather than a thing to behold; it can be a way of perpetually orienting ourselves in relation to the other and human suffering. As an event, we can regard the violent image’s claims to have captured or conveyed otherness as but one orientation, and we can find an unfinished, less reductive bearing with videogames. This bearing was described in the <a href="#1.3" title="1.3 The Videogame as Human Event (a)" target="_blank">previous section</a>. However, that section’s succinctness does not embroil us into the problematic of the violent image, as the culmination of a description of the image as an event.</div>

<div>For that participation to occur, I give my reader this entire document, which follows my own trajectory of thought. With that in mind, it is better to start with familiar conditions. Everything described up to this point has come out of a clarification and refinement of the distinction between the <em>event</em> and the <em>image</em> – not being initially particular about the term <em>image</em>, leaving it to my reader's intuition (as all writing and language must do on some level), the colloquial image, the image on your screen, the billboard, <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em> (Vermeer <a href="#Vermeer 1665" target="_blank" title="Vermeer J (1665) Girl with a pearl earing [painting]">1665</a>), the human in the mirror:</div>

</figure>
<div>– and favouring the event, the act of looking in the mirror, the performance, as more real than what we isolate to be the human image. The image as an object (Sam or V's reflection in <a href="#Figure 5" title="Figure 5: The human in the mirror in the videogame" target="_blank">Figure 5</a>, that which is on our screen) is what we are seeking to point beyond - to eventually disclosed the image as an irreducible event in itself and not ‘a representation… [which] has its actual existence in something other than itself’ (Hegel <a href="#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>:273). We start with the assertion that the image is less real, or that there is a falseness to the image, a failure whenever we regard it as being <em>of</em> something – ‘Ceci n'est pas une pipe’ (Magritte <a href="#Magritte 1929" target="_blank" title="Magritte R (1929) The treachery of images [painting]">1929</a>). In response to the empirically subsisting image, we seek to describe the real, namely the concrete events we find connected to it.</div>
		
<div>This is not a distinction Baudrillard (<a href="#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>:1) made in his description of simulacra, as ‘the generation by models of a real without origin or reality’. Baudrillard describes our postmodern saturation in images as essentially non-specific pertaining to the real. Contrarily, I start from an imperative to convey something that is more than an image, and which could be described as specifically real compared to an image, especially in relation to violent images like the ones shown in <a href="#Figure 2" title="Figure 2: Images of humans in videogames" target="_blank">Figure 2</a> or <a href="#Figure 4" title="Figure 4: Two violent images (rasterized and filmed)" target="_blank">Figure 4</a>. In this mode, an event is real compared to its image regardless of that image’s ambitions to simulate, or successes in simulating, any aspect of reality. Regarding my motivations behind and decisions in writing ‘<a href="#3" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">Violence: The Videogame Event</a>’ as the upshot of this process, I commence with a concern for that which has been recorded (not the recording), in the case of actual documented events. An example of this is the final clip in <a href="#Figure 4" title="Figure 4: Two violent images (rasterized and filmed)" target="_blank">Figure 4</a> in which Nguyễn Ngọc Loan famously kills Nguyễn Văn Lém. In the case of fictional images, like those found in films and videogames, the event I am referring to is that which is being portrayed (not the portrayal). Ellie is a fictional character but the concepts of death, murder, human suffering, etc. are still being portrayed and reduced in the <a href="#Figure 4" title="Figure 4: Two violent images (rasterized and filmed)" target="_blank">above gameplay footage</a>. My first drafts of <a href="#3" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">this level</a> intended to describe the events as more real than (existing independently from) the images which portray or capture them. This moves against Baudrillard’s (<a href="#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>:6) hyperreal, i.e. the rejection of ‘any distinction between the real and the imaginary’. If a simulacrum ‘has no relation to any reality whatsoever’ (Baudrillard <a href="#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>:6), there are no pure simulacra here, for I have a mind to exhaust the description of images down into their real events with videogames. There is always a connection to an irreducible event, be it what is portrayed by the image of a headshot, or the gameplay event that is captured.</div>

<div>Real does not function here as a truth claim. More than Baudrillard’s (<a href="#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>) SOURCES to the real, real is our most familiar term for distinguishing an image from the inexhaustible event that image is of (this was the first distinction I made during research). The breaking up of the image into separate human events could also be described as a critique of the image, in search of some real event hidden therein. We need this initial critique in order to affirm something beyond the text itself, beyond the image being produced by the author. For example, Kant’s (<a href="#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>) noumena, Wittgenstein’s (<a href="#Wittgenstein 1921" target="_blank" title="Wittgenstein L (1921/2014) Tractatus logico-philosophicus">1921/2014</a>:89) ‘what we cannot speak about’ and Gabriel Marcel’s (<a href="#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:55-56) meta-problematic, are thought of as fulfilling this role in their respective philosophical systems or styles. Dilworth refers to this apparently necessary limiting case as simplicity: ‘I say that I think something is completely simple, only because I have really nothing to say of it than merely that it is something’ (Kant cited in Dilworth <a href="#Dilworth 2013" target="_blank" title="">2013</a>:15). Without this kind of critique with its implicit parameters (viz. a reaching for something which is not to be described in the last instance, something which does not and cannot reside within the text itself, Shestov’s [<a href="#Shestov 1916" title="Shestov L (1916) Penultimate words and other essays" target="_blank">1916</a>] last word) there is a lack of significance to whatever occurs and is accomplished. Whether Borges’ (<a href="#Borges 1946" target="_blank" title="Borges JL (1946/1999) Collected fictions">1946/1999</a>:325) map, as simulation/representation/image, ‘precedes the territory’ (Baudrillard <a href="#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>:1) which is real, or if there is no longer any distinction between the map and the terrain itself, we must locate for ourselves a distinction. We always need some infinite concept beyond the text or beyond the image, which overflows it, for the image to be about. On this, I do not need to be specific, beyond separating it out from the events of the image, for it is simply the event that an image is of.</div>

<div>More than a clarification of this project's scope and mission — i.e. to establish the pursuit of something beyond what is reproduced by my HDMI video capture card — this distinction between image and event, and the assertion that an image like this one has the potential to point towards and invite readers into an event, is necessary to fulfil a condition of engagement (to justify the project). Overwise I might just give my reader a few hundred hours of gameplay footage to watch, it being a perfect replication of the event in one narrow sense. But I have designed the image that is this document to be more than a Let’s Play and more than an example of Gillen’s (<a href="#Gillen 2004" target="_blank" title="Gillen K (23 March 2004) 'The new games Journalism', Kieron Gillen's workblog">2004</a>) ‘new dogma… 1) The worth of gaming lies in the gamer not the game. 2) Write travel journalism to Imaginary Places’ – no; this image will perform an explicit invitation towards the real, i.e. towards an inter-human event, even as this document can be regarded as an event.</div>

<div>Of course, every image is an invitation to the event of its consumption, be it a dialogic and creative consumption or otherwise. Within the parameters of its text, this document is an invitation to the former, to regard the reading of it as a means of participating in a human event. Beyond what can be contained in text and recordings of gameplay footage, it is also an invitation to think with and play videogames, to think about the human through videogames in new and unprecedented ways, which extend beyond the scope of this project. For, as I have said, what I produce here, from my perspective, is a mere image. That is, I am reducing two events, the act of this document being read and the real event I am trying to describe, in order to perform the gesture of writing it.</div>

1.5</a> In Anticipation of '<a href="#2" target="_blank" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image">Dialogue: The Videogame Image</a>' Which Concerns the Producing and Consuming of an Image</h3>
		
<div>The second level of this document, titled '<a href="#2" target="_blank" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image">Dialogue: The Videogame Image</a>', is dedicated to the other two events I associated with the image <a href="#1.3p4" target="_blank" title="1.3 The Videogame as Human Event">above</a>, namely consuming and producing the videogame image. In one sense, we could say these two events <em>are</em> the image, they are the image happening, they <em>subsist</em>. While the event that an image is of exists independent of its reduction into an image, these two events begin – this is the state in which I found them – as the performance of that reduction. Further, they are first recognised as constituents of the image; they share a naive genesis with the image, as a thing to be described, of which they are a part.</div>
		
<div>The first drafts of <a href="#2" target="_blank" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image">this level</a> came out of an intention to describe a part of the videogame image in preparation for the real human event of videogames, to be described later. However, the process of writing, and all that that entails, uncovered these ‘parts’ of the image as human events in their own right. We can think of, then, the image-as-problematic-object-to-be-described’s retreat into the third level, where it is destroyed or where the whole image becomes a set of events for us. So, '<a href="#2" target="_blank" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image">Dialogue: The Videogame Image</a>' is to discover the first two elements of the image as complex dialogic and embodied events; a setting out to describe the image only to discover events.</div>
		
<div>This is how we get to the problem of violence, the violence of beholding and reducing the suffering other, addressed in the <a href="#3" title="3 Violence: The Videogame Event" target="_blank">third level</a>. The image, as an event we orient our bodies towards, is stimulating because of the way it can occlude that process, the body of the beholder is concealed in the image. The image pulls us away from our bodies towards a Cartesian abstraction. This abstraction is not the by-product of consuming an image but how the image is experienced, how it is generated. This also entails our passing over and dismissing the body of the suffering other, an otherness which cannot be replicated with pixels, a suffering which can only be seen by placing ourselves, our bodies, in its path.</div>
		
<div>The role of the body in the event of consuming the image is also how the image is produced, for we enter an event with the image’s author, fulfilling what they have anticipated. In videogames, this event becomes explicitly dialogic and radically unresolved. '<a href="#2" target="_blank" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image">Dialogue: The Videogame Image</a>' uses <em>Street Fighter</em> to discover the inter-human dialogic event in the phenomenon of the image. This is done by contrasting the videogame-image with the movement-image of cinema, as Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>; <a href="#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>) describes it. The videogame does not fulfil Deleuze’s descriptions of real movement in cinema, but real movement is discovered through an interactivity, unique to videogames.</div>

<div>The videogame is not an obvious problematic per se for social/cultural anthropology or anthropologies outside or resisting these identifiers, from philosophical anthropologies like Buber’s (<a href="#Buber 1965" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1965) The knowledge of man">1965</a>) or Scheler’s (<a href="#Scheler 1928" target="_blank" title="Scheler M (1928/2009) The human place in the cosmos">1928/2009</a>) to any descendant of the ontological turn. It will be shown that the videogame, in the way I am arguing we approach it, is not a priority within the interlocutions of the discipline wherever we place its parameters.</div>

<div>The recent push for digital ethnography, from Boellstorff et al. (<a href="#Boellstorff 2012" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T, Nardi B, Pearce C and Taylor TL (2012) Ethnography and virtual worlds: a handbook of method">2012</a>), Hine (<a href="#Hine 2015" target="_blank" title="Hine C (2015) Ethnography for the internet: embedded, embodied and everyday">2015</a>), Hjorth et al. (<a href="#Hjorth 2017" target="_blank" title="Hjorth L, Horst H, Galloway A and Bell G (eds) (2017) The Routledge companion to digital ethnography">2017</a>), Pink et al. (<a href="#Pink 2016" target="_blank" title="Pink S, Horst H, Postill J, Hjorth L, Lewis T and Tacchi J (2016) Digital ethnography: principles and practice">2016</a>), Sanjek et al. (<a href="#Sanjek 2016" target="_blank" title="Sanjek R and Tratner W (eds) (2016) eFIELDNOTES: the makings of anthropology in the digital world">2016</a>) or Underberg and Zorn (<a href="#Underberg 2013" target="_blank" title="Underberg NM and Zorn E (2013) Digital ethnography: anthropology, narrative and new media">2013</a>), is symptomatic of an indifference towards the videogame, or any software, as an anthropological problem ‘in its own right’– to quote Handelman (<a href="#Handelman 2005" target="_blank" title="Handelman D (2005) ‘Introduction: why ritual in Its own right? how so?’">2005</a>) and purposefully evoke his framing of ritual. This project is not a traditional ethnography enhanced through or incorporating new technologies (like Lederman <a href="#Lederman 2016" target="_blank" title="Lederman R (2016) ‘Archiving fieldnotes? placing “anthropological records” among plural digital worlds’">2016</a>; Martin <a href="#Martin 2017" target="_blank" title="Martin C (2017) ‘/KAYFABE: an in-depth look at world wrestling entertainment (WWE) and its fandom using digital ethnography’">2017</a>; Postill <a href="#Postill 2017" target="_blank" title="Postill J (2017) ‘Remote ethnography: studying culture from afar’">2017</a>; Underberg and Zorn <a href="#Underberg 2013" target="_blank" title="Underberg NM and Zorn E (2013) Digital ethnography: anthropology, narrative and new media">2013</a>). It does not explore the culture of videogame development (like Romine <a href="#Romine 2016" target="_blank" title="Romine ML (2016) Fractured imaginaries: an ethnography of game design [PhD thesis]">2016</a>; Underberg and Zorn <a href="#Underberg 2013" target="_blank" title="Underberg NM and Zorn E (2013) Digital ethnography: anthropology, narrative and new media">2013</a>:74-81), orbit some digital object (like Besençon and Bozzini <a href="#Besençon 2020" target="_blank" title="Besençon S and Bozzini D (2020) ‘The ethnography of a digital object: an example from computer security’">2020</a>; Pink et al. <a href="#Pink 2016" target="_blank" title="Pink S, Horst H, Postill J, Hjorth L, Lewis T and Tacchi J (2016) Digital ethnography: principles and practice">2016</a>:41-58) or entail fieldwork conducted in a digital location or heterogeneous network become fieldsite (like Boellstorff et al. <a href="#Boellstorff 2012" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T, Nardi B, Pearce C and Taylor TL (2012) Ethnography and virtual worlds: a handbook of method">2012</a>; Burrell <a href="#Burrell 2017" target="_blank" title="Burrell J (2017) ‘The Fieldsite as a network: a strategy for locating ethnographic research’">2017</a>; Hine <a href="#Hine 2015" target="_blank" title="Hine C (2015) Ethnography for the internet: embedded, embodied and everyday">2015</a>; Kraemer <a href="#Kraemer 2016" target="_blank" title="Kraemer J (2016) ‘Doing fieldwork, BRB: locating the field on and with emerging media’">2016</a>). The videogame itself will be our platform for anthropological thought, which is a novel premise. This novelty ought to surprise us, considering the discipline’s historical and continuing interest, influence and overlap into game studies (some significant examples: Ahern <a href="#Ahern 1982" target="_blank" title="Ahern EM (1982) ‘Rules in oracles and games’">1982</a>; Best <a href="#Best 1925" target="_blank" title="Best E (1925/1976) Games and pastimes of the Maori: an account of the various exercises, games, and pastimes of the natives of New Zealand, as practiced in former times; including some information concerning their vocal and instrumental music">1925/1976</a>; Caillois <a href="#Caillois 1961" target="_blank" title="Caillois R (1961/2001) Man, play, and games">1961/2001</a>; Chattoe-Brown <a href="#Chattoe-Brown 2011" target="_blank" title="Chattoe-Brown E (2011) ‘Combining ethnography and game theory using simulation: a critique and development of “can norms account for strategic interaction?” by S.

<div>The present unarticulated assumption among anthropologists, to be qualified below, goes like this: defining and describing videogames is best left to those who are expert in their development and application; anthropology’s problematic does not pertain to the videogame itself, but rather the social phenomena surrounding and within it.</div>
		
<div>I can sympathise with the motivations behind the former – let those people define the things they are doing and making for themselves. It was no Lienhardt’s (<a href="#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>) place to formulate some new conception of the master of the fishing spear’s spears, after all. The spears, as formulated by the Dinka, contributed to Lienhardt’s descriptions of one instance of humanity orienting itself in relation to Divinity or ultra-human forces. This is in the same way the shrine and spears, conveyed in an example of Lienhardt’s (<a href="#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>:plate VI) famous photography, were constituents of an image of the human, forming an essential part of that image, with the mother and child standing over to the left… </div>

	</figcaption>
</figure>
		
<div>The problematic would then be to position the videogame, as a cultural object, in relation to the human, so as to form a new image. This is how Thornham’s (<a href="#Thornham 2011" target="_blank" title="Thornham H (2011) Ethnographies of the videogame: gender, narrative and praxis">2011</a>:10) Ethnographies of the Videogame is positioned, where ‘interviews, reflections, and the recordings of gameplay’ in eleven UK households, constitute her entire methodological gesture. <em>Playing</em> a videogame to understand the human, as participant observation, as ethnographic engagement, is not conceived as part of Thornham’s project. In discussions surrounding the videogame’s legitimacy as art (see Golding <a href="#Golding 2011" target="_blank" title="Golding D (2011) ‘Not art you say?: in defence of videogames’">2011</a>; Ndi <a href="#Ndi 2019" target="_blank" title="Ndi A (2019) ‘Rethinking video games in critical discourse: re-visiting intersections of the ICT hypertext and artistic consumption’">2019</a>), the game is positioned as an artwork, even when nobody is playing it. In these cases, including Thornham’s, the videogame is a thing to be grasped, appraised, analysed, etc. A distance is presupposed and a comparability and containment are bestowed upon human experience to generate specimens.</div>
		
<div>But this is counter to what I have found to be most interesting and valuable in a study of videogames and ignores what makes them unique. So much for defining and describing videogames: videogames discourage these objectifications in the act of playing them. It is only after the fact or before it, when the game is not happening, that we can imagine it as a static phenomenon to be defined, critiqued, and compared to other instances of the videogame or even other art forms.</div>
		
<div>But anthropology’s greatest contributions to the videogame, and the videogame’s greatest contributions to anthropology, will not be found in a style of thought focused on the definition, function or appraisal of a new cultural object. When the videogame is regarded as a thing to be understood, it is essentially extraneous to our application of the anthropological question (What is the human being? [Kant <a href="#Kant 1765" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1765/1992) Lectures on logic">1765/1992</a>:538]), the question this project seeks to apply to videogames. It is context, extra details, but not where we are pointing the question, not a human event of which the researcher can become a part. In this way, I am suggesting we acknowledge an agency in the videogame, as a human event, as its own form of an answer to the anthropological question and as a new way of asking the question (a far cry from Kant’s [<a href="#Kant 1765" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1765/1992) Lectures on logic">1765/1992</a>:538] way).</div>
		
<div>Videogames ought not to simply function within the social structure we ensconce them. In a way that is more obvious than film or any art form (the art status of videogames is tangential) videogames entail an independent network of actors, which makes them radically unresolved. Of course, we can say that everything is unresolved but being unresolved is the videogame’s premise, its first principle, the starting point of our experience with the medium. I say videogames are radically unresolved because any other articulation ignores how they must be regarded to experience them; to perform the event we must regard this image as indeterminate. In the case of a film or novel we can be oblivious to the indeterminate nature of the thing – the book is sitting on my desk; it is a static object. The videogame has parameters, the code, hardware, etc., but the goal is to hide these; they are what you forget in order to make the videogame happen, they recede to bring forth an event.</div>
		
<div>This means videogames can teach a style of thought which regards other mediums and thought projects to be events as well. For example, our explicit participation in the production of a videogame-image can make clear our implicit participation in the cinema, the ‘movement-image’ (Deleuze <a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>). Compared to spears, shrines, paintings, films, and even some interpretations of anthropology, videogames are still in the making in a more obvious sense. And this can constitute a useful thought exercise we might apply beyond the videogame. It can lead us to think dialogically, towards a pregnant otherness, regarding things as not having fully happened yet and no instance of happening is identical. This is an aside and not a philosophical argument, I am not using videogames to do an ontology. The videogame demands a new way of thinking, but this project’s scope will not extend that thinking far beyond it.</div>
		 
<div>The videogame is unresolved, but of course there are identical screen states. The context and role of those states in the unfolding dialogue between player, developer and device are never the same. When I spawned into Demon’s Souls’ (Moore <a href="#Moore 2020" target="_blank" title="Moore G (director) (2020) Demon’s souls [videogame]">2020</a>) Shrine of Storms at Black World Tendency for the forty-third time, the screen’s pixels assumed exactly the same state as the first time, but it was not the same.  Playing a videogame and reflecting on the event itself discourages determining articulations in a way that is only comparable to other software, dialogue, ritual, societies or the world.</div>
		
<div>And by ‘the world’ here I mean everything, that is, ‘all that is the case’ (Wittgenstein <a href="#Wittgenstein 1921" target="_blank" title="Wittgenstein L (1921/2014) Tractatus logico-philosophicus">1921/2014</a>:5), because this project does not treat videogames as visitable locations in which social phenomena transpires. They are not the scene from Lienhardt’s (<a href="#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>:plate VI) photo in which the mother and child happen to be standing over to the left, in which the anthropologist has the opportunity to capture their unique position, their way, of being in the world.</div>
		
<div>This is the more common position among social or cultural anthropologists, with the proviso that the videogame or similar is continuously online, so as to entail social continuity and meet Boellstorff’s (<a href="#Boellstorff 2014" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2014) ‘An afterward in four binarisms’">2014</a>:740; <a href="#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:395) criteria for a ‘virtual world’. Some examples of such ethnographies include Taylor’s (<a href="#Taylor 2006" target="_blank" title="Taylor TL (2006) Play between worlds: exploring online game culture">2006</a>) <em>Play Between Worlds: Exploring Online Game Culture</em>, Boellstorff’s (<a href="#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>) own, <em>Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human</em>, Nardi’s (<a href="#Nardi 2010" target="_blank" title="Nardi BA (2010) My life as a night elf priest: an anthropological account of World of Warcraft">2010</a>) <em>My Life as a Night Elf Priest: An Anthropological Account of World of Warcraft</em>, Rowlands’ (<a href="#Rowlands 2012" target="_blank" title="Rowlands T (2012) Video game worlds: working at play in the culture of EverQuest">2012</a>) <em>Video Game Worlds: Working at Play in the Culture of EverQuest</em> and Sundén and Sveningsson’s (<a href="#Sundén 2012" target="_blank" title="Sundén J and Sveningsson M (2012) Gender and sexuality in online game cultures: passionate play">2012</a>) <em>Gender and Sexuality in Online Game Cultures</em>. But all these projects have entirely different objectives to the present one. That is, ethnographies like these are not anthropologies of the videogame; they are studies of or with the people who play videogames within a virtual world. Here, the videogame is accepted as a potential location in which social and cultural events can transpire. I do not directly dispute this assumption, but I do wish to point out that a more basic human event has been stepped over in the framing of the above projects, namely the videogame itself.</div>
		
<div>The above projects have not questioned the videogame as a human event. They already have working conceptions of the videogame as a platform, which is evident in their methodologies, in how they regard ‘games like EverQuest [as] fundamentally social spaces’ (Taylor <a href="#Taylor 2006" target="_blank" title="Taylor TL (2006) Play between worlds: exploring online game culture">2006</a>:10), an ‘online fieldsite’ (Boellstorff <a href="#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>:5) from which to collect or generate data through ‘normal anthropological methods including participant observation and interviews’ (Boellstorff <a href="#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>:4). To ‘take Second Life’s emergence as given and work to analyse the cultural practices and beliefs taking form within it’ (Boellstorff <a href="#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>:5, my italics) is to prioritise the application of familiar methods over the unprecedented human event, the dialogic image, the rasterized image as new transcendental category, which occurs every time we turn on the PlayStation.</div>
		
<div>If the videogame image was simply a cultural object or virtual fieldsite, we could just play <em>World of Warcraft</em> (Dabiri and Guerrero <a href="#Dabiri 2004" target="_blank" title="Dabiri S and Guerrero C (producers) (2004) World of warcraft [videogame]">2004</a>) ourselves, do our own ‘frantic clicking [to] produce the salutary effect of killing the monster’, instead of reading Nardi’s (<a href="#Nardi 2010" target="_blank" title="Nardi BA (2010) My life as a night elf priest: an anthropological account of World of Warcraft">2010</a>:5) account. A gentleman reading <em>Witchcraft, oracles, and Magic Among the Azande</em> at Oxford in the late 1930s had no way of consulting a poison oracle himself, for it was as the Zande said: ‘perhaps in their country people are not murdered by witches, but here they are’ (Evans-Pritchard <a href="#Evans-Pritchard 1937" target="_blank" title="Evans-Pritchard EE (1937/1976) Witchcraft, oracles, and magic among the Azande">1937/1976</a>:221). ‘Here’, Zandeland, was Evans-Pritchard’s (<a href="#Evans-Pritchard 1937" target="_blank" title="Evans-Pritchard EE (1937/1976) Witchcraft, oracles, and magic among the Azande">1937/1976</a>) privilege, and his research has value today as a historical document for that aspect alone, even without its tacit identification of ‘webs of meaning’ in Western systems of thought. But when anthropology is applied to the production of digital images like videogames, historical documentation of human expression is not an ancillary function/appeal that can distract us, we are here for something else, some other type of image. Here, the theoretical picture becomes essential and Rowlands' (<a href="#Rowlands 2012" target="_blank" title="Rowlands T (2012) Video game worlds: working at play in the culture of EverQuest">2012</a>:157) description of a Durkheimian division of labour in <em>EverQuest</em> (McQuaid <a href="#McQuaid 1999" target="_blank" title="McQuaid B (1999) EverQuest [videogame]">1999</a>), with its collectivist/individualist tensions and contradictions, is more important than descriptions of how the ‘enormous rhinoceroses wander obstinately across the horizon, accompanied by human-sized, golden-feathered cockatrices…’ (Rowlands <a href="#Rowlands 2012" target="_blank" title="Rowlands T (2012) Video game worlds: working at play in the culture of EverQuest">2012</a>:57). The latter is already present in a different text, a text which is closer to Wittgenstein’s (<a href="#Wittgenstein 1921" target="_blank" title="Wittgenstein L (1921/2014) Tractatus logico-philosophicus">1921/2014</a>:25) ambition for a logically perfect language, ‘a proposition which shows its sense’, namely the game itself, overtaking the limited significations of ethnographic prose.</div>
		
<div>This is notwithstanding the autoethnographic value of a text too, where the ethnographic image is determined by and made subordinate to the researcher’s point of entry. This includes when the researcher’s subjectivity serves as the impetus for the framing of a sociological question, like in Sveningsson’s (<a href="#Sveningsson 2012" target="_blank" title="Sveningsson M (2012) ‘Go with your passion!’">2012</a>:22) case, ‘how female gamers experience the games, gaming activities and gaming cultures, from their perspective as female gamers’. This less ambitious, more specific than it is transcendental (Kant’s [<a href="#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>:A12] ‘transcendental’), more personal, style of question is not fundamentally reflexive towards the evolution of the human condition through videogames in the way this project is. Rather, a question is being applied to a predefined, determinate, instance of the human – that which we talk about when we talk about ourselves – not the human proper.</div>
		
<div>Considering all these examples, my negative apologia of anthropology’s orientation vis-à-vis the videogame comes to this: none of these authors know what a videogame is. They are doing anthropology while doing a videogame or doing anthropology with the people who play videogames while taking the videogame ‘as given’. In this way, they generate an image of the human in or performing the videogame à la Lienhardt’s (<a href="#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>:plate VI) photo of the woman and child standing over to the left, and instead of spears and a shrine there is a videogame or the videogame is where they are standing; here is the human (maybe a new and underrepresented type) and here is the thing (maybe a new and underrepresented type) and here is an image of the two and we can see what they have to do with each other, and understand each one better, and we have given each one a voice – the voice we had in mind.</div>
		
<div>And here are two problems: (1) the videogame is already an image without us giving anything to it at all and (2) the videogame, online social network or otherwise, is not an object or a place but an event. Ethnographies and anthropological engagements heretofore performed with the videogame in mind – and even outside any attempts at anthropological framing – prioritise the convenient application of familiar methodologies and theory over the fact that videogames entail a new human image event.</div>

2 DIALOGUE: THE VIDEOGAME IMAGE</h2>
	
	<h3 id="2.1"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.1</a> Videogames via the Cinema</h3>
		
<div>It is easy to approach the videogame image via the cinema, at least as a first step. This is because thinking with videogames through concepts owed to cinema entails language and concepts that are familiar to us. Though Galloway’s (<a href="#Galloway 2006" target="_blank" title="Galloway AR (2006) Gaming: essays on algorithmic culture">2006</a>:2) definition of videogames draws a clear distinction between the two mediums — ‘If photographs are images, and films are moving images, then video games are actions’ — he still relies on cinematographic language and gestures to explore what videogames are doing. For example, the first-person shooter is described as a POV shot, and Italian neorealism is evoked to urge videogames towards a social realism, focused on ‘narrative, not representation’ (Galloway <a href="#Galloway 2006" target="_blank" title="Galloway AR (2006) Gaming: essays on algorithmic culture">2006</a>:39,75,80). When Atkins (<a href="#Atkins 2003" target="_blank" title="Atkins B (2003) More than a game: the computer game as fictional form">2003</a>:24) imagines some future day when ‘…perhaps, the computer game will even produce its À la Recherche du Temps Perdu or its Ulysses, its Casablanca or its Citizen Kane’, it is easy to see his point. When will the videogame produce, and (perhaps more importantly) be recognised for, the kind of penetrating reflections on life and the human condition commonly celebrated in the classics of literature and cinema? And this question assumes such classics will surely reveal themselves in time, for the videogame is assumed to be on a similar trajectory to other mediums born out of older technologies, most recently cinema.</div>

<div>And it is easy to regard many videogames as a kind of interactive film, especially when they are so often designed and presented in cinematic ways. Motion capture is now a stage of development many films and videogames share: the capturing and reproduction of movement for the sake of an image it has not yet become. Computer generated images are not an essential part of videogames or films, but both have embraced that style of image making. There is a clear difference in application. Videogames usually need the image of gameplay to be one continuous shot, so motion capture is reserved to those instances where videogames express what is unique about them the least: the cutscene. The exception to this is the interactive cutscene, like the dance battle in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> (Nomura et al. <a href="#Nomura 2020" target="_blank" title="Nomura T, Hamaguchi N and Toriyama M (directors) (2020) Final fantasy vii remake [videogame]">2020</a>) or the torture scene in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> (Druckmann et al. <a href="#Druckmann 2020" target="_blank" title="Druckmann N, Newman A and Margenau K (directors) (2020) The last of us part ii [videogame]">2020</a>). These are pulling the functions of the original cutscene, where videogames resemble film, into the realm of interactivity. These instances, especially when they are taken outside the broader context of the videogames they are a part of, can feel and look like watching a film which demands occasional button presses to be sure we are paying attention. </div>
		
<div>Interactive or otherwise, cutscenes have been a part of videogames since we started traversing 3D worlds, at least since <em>Super Mario 64</em> (Miyamoto <a href="#Miyamoto 1996" target="_blank" title="Miyamoto S (director) (1996) Super Mario 64 [videogame]">1996</a>). There we see the visuals of gameplay itself presenting a greater conceptual hurdle in the minds of developers and players than the game’s cutscenes. The opening cutscene (see <a href="#Figure 7" title="Figure 7: Super Mario 64" target="_blank">Figure 7</a>) attempts to provide a diegetic explanation for the new cinematic element of gameplay, namely an adjustable camera following the controllable character. It opens with a sweeping aerial shot of Peach’s castle, following one of the Lakitu Bros. — a turtle-like creature, floating on a cloud, holding a fishing rod with a camera attached to it. We see a pipe come out of the ground and the Lakitu Bro. circles around. It then cuts to a POV shot of the pipe from the Lakitu Bro.’s camera’s perspective, Mario jumps out of the pipe, and this is how we are introduced to the floating continuous shot following the controllable character in third-person videogames. When we move the camera around Mario, we are actually controlling one of the Lakitu Bros.</div>

<div>This was demonstrated to us in the first instance via the language of cinema, a language we already understood. What we see in <em>Super Mario 64</em> has become the standard transition from cutscene to gameplay. The over-the-shoulder-shot pulls us into the image, it hands us the reigns or, more accurately, poses to the viewer a question and by answering that question the viewer becomes a player. We have come to expect this kind of shot, this transition where cinema metamorphizes into a videogame. Its worth noting how <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> plays with that expectation in its opening cutscene. We are eager to take control, and the camera teases us by first settling behind Biggs and then Barret before finally orienting us in relation to the game’s protagonist, Cloud.</div>

2.2</a> Connecting the Mediums</h3>
		
<div>Does this demonstrate how strongly cinema has framed our comprehension of new media, or the immaturity of the videogame as a medium itself? A medium’s immaturity is what Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:3) identified in early cinema, for</div>
<blockquote class="small">…things and people are always forced to conceal themselves, have to conceal themselves when they begin. What else could they do? They come into being within a set which no longer includes them and, in order not to be rejected have to project the characteristics which they retain in common with the set.</blockquote>
<div>Thus, just as cinema only commenced as an imitation of natural perception before later evolving into the movement-image, <em>Super Mario 64</em> had to present itself as an interactive cinema, not only because that is what was understandable to us but because that is what the videogame understood itself to be.</div>

<div>But this association with cinema does not work in every respect. One major difference is that, in many ways, the videogame’s resemblance to cinema does not describe the medium’s genesis but one of its strivings. There were certainly 2D videogames before there were 3D ones. And while the medium commenced with the manipulation of symbols and shapes in the forms of <em>Pong</em> (Alcorn <a href="#Alcorn 1972" target="_blank" title="Alcorn A (designer) (1972) Pong [videogame]">1972</a>) and <em>Pac-Man</em> (Iwatani and Ishimura <a href="#Iwatani 1980" target="_blank" title="Iwatana T and Ishimura S (designers) (1980) Pac-Man [videogame]">1980</a>; see Rodgers <a href="#Rodgers 2020" target="_blank" title="Rodgers T (23 November 2020) 'Action button reviews Pac-Man' [video]">2020</a>:<a href="https://youtu.be/GPzVlTgZoCg?t=190" target="_blank">3’10”</a>), the pursuit of the spectacle of photo-realism has led the videogame to resemble the movement-image of cinema more closely. Regardless of what we classify to be the first true videogame, and it is not Deleuze’s (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>) style (and especially not Bergson’s [<a href="#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>], as we will see) to draw clear distinctions like that anyway, the cinematic videogame was an event for the medium. It was the beginning of a new form of encountering and participating in images – the event of the videogame image had become something new.</div>
		
<div>Videogames did not evolve out of cinema, but the illusions of movement in videogames have been developed with the cinema in mind. Cinema, while absent from most definitions of, or origin stories for, the medium of videogames, has been a constant reference for the medium’s application of the cinematographic illusion, especially once games became 3D. But none of this has barred the videogame event, its performance as an image, from its own creative evolution. For, the cinematographic illusion has still been made to serve and probed according to a new style. What could have once been described as a movement-image, has now been forced to change, fundamentally, in adopting the context of a videogame, notwithstanding remnant resemblances of the form that inspired it. A brief description of that cinematographic form will be necessary for what follows.</div>
	
	<h3 id="2.3"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.3</a> The Movement-Image</h3>

<div>According to Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>, <a href="#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>), cinema gives us real movement. That is, from the illusion of movement created by a series of still frames presented rapidly and at equal distance from each other, movement is ‘extracted from itself’ (Deleuze <a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:24). From the illusion, cinema extracts ‘real movement’, not by adding movement to a still image, imitating natural perception, but via the mobilisation of a set. This mobilisation is accomplished through the movement of the camera and through cinematographic techniques like montage (Deleuze <a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:25). The set of frames that originally formed a cinematographic illusion, are mobilised through a breach of the limitations of the subject. The camera moves freely and instantly through space and time and in this way generates real movement.</div>
		
<div>But it will not become clear exactly why or how this transcendence of subject and object constitutes real movement until the Bergsonian picture of movement Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>) had in mind is clarified. Real movement, for Bergson (<a href="#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>), is infinite in two complementary ways which nullify the movement from, and the distinction between, a subject and object.</div>
		
<div>Real movement is absolutely indivisible (Bergson <a href="#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:246-253, <a href="#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>:194-200). When measuring a trajectory, we consider the changes in distance between two or more objects over time. The line imagined between the objects, which is divided into sections and referred to in order to describe the movement, does not convey the whole movement itself (Bergson <a href="#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:246). The line can be divided an infinite number of times, as shown in Zeno’s paradox (Aristotle Physics, book VI),  but then we are only dividing ‘the line supposed to have been traversed, and not the movement traversing it’ (Bergson <a href="#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:246). The whole movement is already given instantly by our perception. Concrete parameters cannot be drawn around movement itself, only the divisible path we imagine to retrospectively describe it.</div>
		
<div>Real movement is absolutely relative (Bergson <a href="#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:254-255,267). In physics, movement can be considered a universal phenomenon of the acentred whole (Bergson <a href="#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:254). Everything is moving in relation to everything else on both a macro and a micro scale. Descriptions of these movements can only be extracted once a point of reference or centre is selected and a line is drawn between the points. But these details will only describe a change over time within those finite parameters. Real movement is relative to an infinite number of points in addition to our bodies. Thus, movements are acentred vibrations encompassing the entire universe.</div>
		
<div>Bergson (<a href="#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>) rejected distinctions between the subject and the object in the same way. The body is not immune to the above critique of parameters and limits; there is no absolute threshold separating it from other objects grouped together to understand the world; ‘the visual perception of an object, the brain, nerves, retina and the object itself form a connected whole’ (Bergson <a href="#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:285). Perception, as a movement, cannot be divided into sections and still retain the whole that is immediately given, as would be necessary to distinguish subject and object. Neither can one’s body be placed at the centre of all movements in the universe without losing the image of the whole movement (Bergson <a href="#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:260). In this way, pure subjectivity and individual identity are turned away from real movement.</div>
		
<div>Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>) used these same Bergsonian arguments against dualism to describe the cinema. In Bergson’s (<a href="#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>, <a href="#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>) description of movement, there is always another division to be made, another body in space from which to measure the trajectory’s relative position and another position itself, constantly emerging. In cinema, Deleuze saw that there was always another shot, always another frame that is different from the one before it as an acentred movement through space and time. Thus, through montage, by virtue of the movement becoming acentred, cinema comes closer to real movement than natural perception. The essence of the cinema is to transcend the subject and the object through acentred movements.</div>
		
<div>At least, this is one way of describing the creative evolution that has taken place: the cinema’s gradual discovery of the mobilisation of its sections in pursuit of the new. This is what Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:141-177; <a href="#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>) charts in <em>Cinema 1</em> and <em>Cinema 2</em>, from the centred action-image where everything is confined to react to the centre of a set, to the acentred time-image, where a linear narrative is abandoned to mobilise the image further. Cinema does not give us an illusion of movement through immobile sections, it mobilises sections through qualitative change or the production of the new (Deleuze <a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:9).</div>
	
	<h3 id="2.4"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.4</a> No Montage in Gameplay</h3>
		
<div>Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:24) asks, ‘What happened when the camera was fixed?’, leading into a description of ‘a primitive state of the cinema where the image is in movement rather than being a movement-image’. This is how the early cinema, its essence not yet realised, imitated the mediums that preceded it like theatre, photography or natural perception (Deleuze <a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:25). The idea of montage had not yet emerged, so in this early version of the medium, ‘there is therefore no communication of mutually referring variable sets’ (Deleuze 1983/2013:24). Shots were stationary and the movements within were spatially determined (Deleuze <a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:3,24). Movement was therefore localised to the things themselves, like scientific representations of movement, the cinematographic illusion amounts to points on a line over time (Deleuze <a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:24). This absolute centre, around which the characters and objects are referenced, means relativity is also absent. While the movement-image’s genesis cannot be truly identified, for the same reason a point on a trajectory is only a convenience and can always be made more precise, we can at least say that early cinema did not yet provide what Deleuze calls a movement-image.</div>

<div>But this lack of mutually referring sets preventing early cinema from achieving a movement-image is what we find in most videogames, at least during gameplay.  Montage generally goes against the idea of fluid and comprehensible gameplay. In the <a href="https://youtu.be/5jveLZT-Dgw?t=208" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em> Remake dance battle</a> mentioned earlier, the player must push different buttons in time with the music to make Cloud dance. The camera is completely mobile, constantly cutting to different shots, making the entire process disorientating and difficult to play. I just wanted to watch Cloud dance but was instead forced to concentrate on a tiny spot on the screen telling me which button to push and when, as it changed position with every new shot. This demonstrates a tension in videogame design between a desire to move towards what is appealing in a cinematographic language and the parameters necessary to make gameplay clear, intelligible, and fair for players.</div>
		
<div>Thus, videogames mark an involuntary return, in a sense, to the static camera of early cinema to clarify its gameplay elements. Restricting camera movement also restricts the key innovations of early cinema that led to the movement-image. There is, therefore, something fundamental in the gesture of videogames running counter to Bergson’s (<a href="#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:337; <a href="#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>) descriptions of real movement.</div>
		
<div id="2.4p4">Cutscenes might be described as an exception when the camera ceases to provide a single continuous shot. But even if we follow Keogh’s (<a href="#Keogh 2018" target="_blank" title="Keogh B (2018) A play of bodies: how we perceive videogames">2018</a>:118) argument and include cutscenes as part of the videogame event, cutscenes still depend on gameplay for the role they play in a videogame. As we saw at the begining of <a href="#2" target="_blank">this level</a>, cutscenes represent what is most analytically familiar to us, what is easiest to articulate, in the phenomenon. However, this is not to suggest cutscenes and cinema are the same thing or have the same effect on the player. In the case of a cutscene, one’s orientation towards the images is completely different. Someone could walk in on the final cutscene of a Hideo Kojima (<a href="#Kojima 2008" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2008) Metal gear solid 4: guns of the patriots [videogame]">2008</a>, <a href="#Kojima 2015" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2015) Metal gear solid V: the phantom pain [videogame]">2015</a>, <a href="#Kojima 2019" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2019) Death stranding [videogame]">2019</a>, etc.) game and feel like they were watching a movie, but the player would have a different experience. That difference emerges out of the cutscene’s proximity to gameplay for the player. During gameplay the camera is tied to a single point, like the playable character or arena, in order to facilitate player agency. That context precedes any Deleuzian images we could identify in the cutscene as a text. That history of agency frames what the cutscene means and what it is accomplishing. For, the production of a new videogame image is the result of player agency within the image event. In contrast, the technique of montage is an interruption, a removal of agency. Compared to a videogame, a film has already happened. I had not finished taking in the futuristic depictions of Los Angeles in <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> (Villeneuve <a href="#Villeneuve 2017" target="_blank" title="Villeneuve D (director) (2017) Blade Runner 2049 [motion picture]">2017</a>), but the story kept moving regardless. A videogame must give me time, like a novel or comics, if it is to be, as Galloway says, an action. And unlike other mediums, the videogame can also provide space, in addition to time, as another plane on which agency can be applied. The cost of this is the tethering of the camera to my decisions.</div>
	
	<h3 id="2.5"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.5</a> No Movement in Street Fighter</h3>
		
<div>We can see this most clearly in 2D fighting games like <em>Street Fighter</em> (Funamizu et al. <a href="#Funamizu 1995" target="_blank" title="Funamizu N, Murata H and Itsuno H (designers) (1995) Street fighter alpha 3 [videogame]">1995</a>; Nakayama <a href="#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>; Nishiyama <a href="#Nishiyama 1987" target="_blank" title="Nishiyama T (director) (1987) Street fighter [videogame]">1987</a>; Okamoto <a href="#Okamoto 1991" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y (director) (1991) Street fighter II [videogame]">1991</a>; Okamoto et al. <a href="#Okamoto 1999" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y, Funamizu N and Nakajima (producers) (1999) Street fighter III: 3rd strike [videogame]">1999</a>; Tsukamoto <a href="#Tsukamoto 2008" target="_blank" title="Tsukamoto T (director) (2008) Street fighter IV [videogame]">2008</a>) where there are no changing perspectives, not even via the direction of a Lakitu Bro., and the camera is static save some automatic adjustments, along a two dimensional plane, to keep both players in view. Centred illusions of movement give us a single shot that is a side-on view of both player’s characters. Thus, while Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>) was able to redeem cinema from Bergson’s (<a href="#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>:194-195) critique of the cinematographic illusion through a description of cinema’s acentred movements, in <em>Street Fighter</em> the critique finds a new home. The character animations in <em>Street Fighter</em>, like early cinema, only imitate movement with a series of still frames and the by-product is an illusion and does not, according to Deleuze’s descriptions of cinema, constitute real movement.</div>
<figure>

<div>Finishing moves are a brief exception to this in the franchise’s more recent instalments. But these, as a rule, must be short because the player cannot control their character while they are happening. The insertion of cinematographic techniques here is used to implement how long the move takes to accomplish and elevate the spectacle and drama of a fight. But there is a feeling that the game proper has been paused in these instances, like watching a replay in sport after missing the actual in-game occurrence it is a reproduction of. Once this brief change in perspective has been accomplished, we can get back to the fight, along with all the rigid parameters that make it possible.</div>

<div>We can see in <em>Street Fighter</em> that this apprehension of the camera does place a kind of limit on space and time as a result of having given them to the player. In cinema, the viewer has no control over them but the camera relishes in their manipulation. <em>Street Fighter</em> only exists within a set of tight parameters, an idea obviously counter to Bergson’s (<a href="#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>) descriptions of real movement. The actions available to the player are limited; there are three punch buttons, three kick buttons and a directional pad or stick to move the player’s avatar left and right, to crouch and jump. A border encloses the animations, and nothing exists outside it. The available illusions of movements create a finite illusion of space. After a match, the illusion of space and time is destroyed, for available contributing actions are zero and the successive equidistant frames have ceased. In this way, the parameters of Street Fighter, as a game ‘circumscribed within limits of space and time’ (Caillois <a href="#Caillois 2001" target="_blank" title="Caillois R (1961/2001) Man, play, and games">1961/2001</a>:9), come from the limits placed on the illusions of movement in-game. The animations or illusions of movement as actions chosen by the player, not movement-images, are foundational to the entire experience of <em>Street Fighter</em>. The player has extended a part of themselves into the event of the image or cinematographic illusion as it is being produce and some limitations are necessary for that to occur; developers give players a finite set of possibilities.</div>

<div>This is how the human participates in the production of a videogame image, i.e. the event of image production in dialogic collaboration with a developer who has established parameters to create a space for player agency. This problematic emerged for us and we are so far coming to terms with it in the same way we came to terms with the fixed camera following Mario in <em>Super Mario 64</em>. That is, via the concepts of, and in contrast to, the cinema.</div>

2.6</a> What is a Videogame?</h3>
		
<div>The description of videogames as a human event is counter to agendas that seek to define what a videogame is. Rough (<a href="#Rough 2018" target="_blank" title="Rough B (2018) ‘Videogames as neither video nor games: a negative ontology’">2018</a>:33), in his definition, gives some examples of videogames without any visual component at all, like ‘videogames for the visually impaired’, to prove that video or images are nonessential to the phenomenon. But the character animations <em>are</em> an essential part of <em>Street Fighter</em> and autonomy over them is how we experience the game. This is not to use <em>Street Fighter</em> to say something general that can be applied to all videogames. Rather, <em>Street Fighter</em> reveals something the videogame is doing with the cinematographic illusion. This speaks to the possibilities of human experience in relation to videogames as a dialogic and evolving event. As an event, rigid definitions of the videogame prevent us from following along with it. I will use the word ‘game’ to refer to a videogame for the same reason. ‘Game’, ‘gaming’ and ‘gamer’ are all words used to identify with and refer to the experience of playing a videogame. Why should we not allow the phenomenon of the videogame to change and influence our understand of what a game is? Games are also human events, as is video and the cinematographic illusion. Videogames give us an opportunity to explore the coalescence of these elements. If we set criteria prior to any engagement with the event itself, we risk occluding our view of the emergence of the new.</div>
		
<div><a href="#2.4p4" target="_blank" title="'Someone could walk in on the final cutscene of a Hideo Kojima game and feel like they were watching a movie, but the player would have a different experience.'">Above</a> I mentioned the possibility of regarding a typical Kojima (<a href="#Kojima 2008" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2008) Metal gear solid 4: guns of the patriots [videogame]">2008</a>, <a href="#Kojima 2015" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2015) Metal gear solid V: the phantom pain [videogame]">2015</a>, <a href="#Kojima 2019" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2019) Death stranding [videogame]">2019</a>, etc.) game as a film and it is possible to do this with any videogame. Videogames have the potential to contain films within them – a movie could be playing on a TV screen in the gameworld, a cutscene can be taken out of context, and player autonomy can be ignored and we can pretend that gameplay is just another shot of a film. Some have taken this to mean videogames, and those ambitions attached to it like VR, represent the next evolutionary step in visual media through a lens of progressivism. Our own Kojima (cited in Gibson <a href="#Gibson 2006" target="_blank" title="Gibson E (24 January 2006) 'Games aren’t art, says Kojima'">2006</a>) famously gave license to this line of thought when he said,</div>
<blockquote class="small">…Art is the stuff you find in the museum, whether it be a painting or a statue. What I'm doing, what videogame creators are doing, is running the museum - how do we light up things, where do we place things, how do we sell tickets?For better or worse, what I do, Hideo Kojima, myself, is run the museum and also create the art that's displayed in the museum.</blockquote>
		
<div>But here, Kojima is describing an inherent quality of images generally. Everyone who sees the painting, <a href="https://i.ibb.co/nk3Zkx8/1280px-Whistlers-Mother-high-res.jpg" target="_blank" title="Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1"><em>Whistler’s Mother</em></a> (Whistler <a href="#Whistler 1871" target="_blank" title="Whistler JM (1871) Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1 [painting]">1871</a>), notices the painting within a painting, hanging on the wall. It has always been possible to contain images within other images, leading to new contexts and experiences in relation to the image. While videogames certainly entail new ways of encountering images, we must not forget that Kojima’s museum is, itself, an image. This is not a feature that makes videogames a unique human experience, neither is it why they are interesting.</div>
		
<div>But the most straight forward critique here might be Žižek’s (<a href="#Žižek 2008" target="_blank" title="Žižek S (2008) The plague of fantasies">2008</a>), which he gave in relation to cyberspace, regarding the ‘unbearable closure of being’. For, unlike an actual museum, the gameworld is inevitably closed, there is a finitude in how the experience is contained and does not overflow me. Of course, a videogame can be infinite in a mathematical sense, in a sense convenient to the computer. But Žižek’s point is that this type of infinity is exactly what leads to the closure, a phenomenon revealing all its parts indefinitely with nothing that is, in principle, inaccessible. A randomly generated world might extend forever while at the same time concealing very little. In videogames we do not need to wonder; we do not need an excess.</div>
		
<div>Now, if there is something that distinguishes the various image mediums like painting, photography, cinema or videogames, it is not that each one represents a higher order, like the idea that each new medium contains all the previous ones within it. It is that each medium entails a new way of using images to orientate us towards being, towards something irreducible and open. In the case of videogames specifically it is towards the image itself as being, towards the image as an irreducible event. Hence, this project is interested in videogames for the way they orient us in relation to the event of the image, which is to move beyond the perception of the videogame image being a collection of calculated and pre-planned frames, and beyond the videogame image as a limited version of the Deleuze’s (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>) movement-image.</div>
		
<div> Compared to other mediums today, paintings provide a profound lack of stimulation and detail regarding space and time, we have to lend those elements to it ourselves. There is not enough detail to make out most of the dancers is Renoir’s (<a href="#Renoir 1876" target="_blank" title="Renoir PA (1876) Bal du moulin de la Galette [painting]">1876</a>) <em>Bal du moulin de la Galette</em>, not to mention all those that have been chopped off in the framing of the image. But ‘chopped off’ is a photographical way of describing it anyway, inappropriate for a painting. The dancers which are not in the frame, those which Renoir never painted are an essential component of the experience of the image and, in one important sense, the whole point. I am not referring to the closure we see in gestalt theory, where the incomplete fragments of an object suggest the whole to perception. Rather, the entire purpose of that which was painted is to persuade us towards a more vague and mysterious experience of that which was not. Becoming acquainted with the latter, which is to make our contribution to the painting as viewer, is what pulls us into the picture. If every border, the moment we experience that boundary, spawned a new image, we will have indeed stumbled into Žižek’s (<a href="#Žižek 2008" target="_blank" title="Žižek S (2008) The plague of fantasies">2008</a>) ‘unbearable closure’. The confinement of the painting directs us towards the mystery of being.</div>

</figure>

<div>Cinema not only enables movement through space within the image itself, but the montage allows images to be juxtaposed and communicate temporally. The role of time here is an important thing to note because comics, McCloud (<a href="#McCloud 1994" target="_blank" title="McCloud S (1994) Understanding comics: the invisible art">1994</a>:7-8) famously illustrates, also juxtapose images sequentially, albeit through space on the page. Next to comics, cinema is the creative evolution of sequential images when the temporal experience of each section has been surrendered over to the machine, or to the film maker via the machine. This process, along with photography and the cinematographic illusion, enabled the image to become something new, as we have seen Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>; <a href="#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>) explore. Because we have no control over the camera, a sense of wonder can be constantly evoked through the composition of the shot and montage. The cinema is, in a sense, always beyond us and outside our control and this constitutes the image event of cinema.</div>
		
<div>And this is all another way of describing what Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (<a href="#Saint-Exupéry 1943" target="_blank" title="Saint-Exupéry A (1943/2020) The little prince">1943/2020</a>) was expressing when he wrote the The Little Prince. At the end of the story, the Little Prince is dying and the star that is his home is too small to point out; ‘It’s better that way. My star will be just another star in the sky. That way you’ll love watching all the stars’ (Saint-Exupéry <a href="#Saint-Exupéry 1943" target="_blank" title="Saint-Exupéry A (1943/2020) The little prince">1943/2020</a>:100). The Little Prince understands the need for mystery to give things meaning, to be able to give ourselves to them, to surrender.</div>
		
<div>Are videogames, then, another example of the image’s yielding to closer, like Žižek’s (<a href="#Žižek 2008" target="_blank" title="Žižek S (2008) The plague of fantasies">2008</a>) descriptions of cyberspace? <em>Star Citizen</em> (Roberts <a href="#Roberts n.d." target="_blank" title="Roberts C (n.d.) Star citizen [videogame]">n.d.</a>), <em>No Man Sky</em> (Murry et al. <a href="#Murry 2016" target="_blank" title="Murry S, Duncan G, Doyle R and Ream D (directors) (2016) No man’s sky [videogame]">2016</a>) or <em>Elite Dangerous</em> (Braben <a href="#Braben 2014" target="_blank" title="Braben D (director) (2014) Elite dangerous [videogame]">2014</a>) represent an ambition in videogames which nullifies the Little Prince’s dying gesture. They are moving towards a gameworld in which the stars and planets players see in the sky are accessible destinations, which can be intimately explored. The orbiting planets in <em>Outer Wilds</em> (Beachum <a href="#Beachum 2019" target="_blank" title="Beachum A (director) (2019) Outer wilds [videogame]">2019</a>) are something to be accessed, solved and overcome, rather than something to be overcome by.</div>
		
<div>This brings us to a more revealing problematic to be explored in relation to videogames than any attempt at definitions. That is to identify the medium’s point of openness, the location of the event. Where is the irreducible event in the videogame as an image? And this is the same asking where the human is, in the videogame image. This can be answered with a description of how the image is made, or how we collaborate in the production of a videogame image in a way that is unambiguous, on display, part of the image itself, not an interpretation – the image becomes an explicit human event.</div>

2.7</a> Indivisible Movement in <em>Street Fighter</em></h3>

<div>While illusions of movement can be located in the cinema’s genesis, the same cannot be said of the videogame’s origins, for the videogame constitutes and entirely different human event, notwithstanding its appropriation of cinematographic gestures and notwithstanding my own use of cinema to leverage this analyses of the videogame image. In cinema, the illusion was something to grow out of, it had to be transgressed for the sake of its own creative evolution. The early forms of interactive media were text-based, and the cinematographic illusion was later adopted as a supplemental — a spectacle which the industry immediately adopted as its quest. Thus, videogames have never needed to mobilise the image, from the beginning the illusion was immediately incorporated as one of many mobile interactive elements.</div>

<div>In <em>Street Fighter</em> and other 2D fighting games, we will see that the images are mobile, constituting ‘real movement’ in the Deleuzian sense, even when the task of playing the game requires one to understand them as illusions. Though the game’s mechanics are built around the cinematographic illusion, we will identify indivisible movement in the broad interaction that is required to learn and play the game as a dialogic human event. Further, the more in-game animations are considered to be illusions of movement, the more meaning they have in the context of the game and are mobilised as constituents of the event. In <em>Street Fighter</em>, illusions of movement can break down and become real events along a different trajectory, namely player agency and dialogue. This case shows how the effort to think false movement in the context of a videogame image does not compromise the legitimacy of the performance which constitutes a human event. To clarify how this works in <em>Street Fighter</em>, I will need to describe the game’s basic and complex mechanics and what they demand from the player.</div>

2.8</a> How to Win at <em>Street Fighter</em></h3>
		
<div>Playing <em>Street Fighter V</em> (Nakayama <a href="#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>) well can entail a deep understanding of its character animations. This is true to the point where the illusions of movement are broken, and animations are temporarily regarded to be a series of separate equidistant still images. Each character animation has a set number of startup, active and recovery frames. Startup frames describe how many frames of animation take place before any damage is inflicted on the opponent, during which the player is vulnerable. Active frames are those in which an attack does damage if the opponent crosses the path of the action and fails to block. Recovery frames are those frames in which a character is completing the animation and cannot yet commence a new one, during which the player is vulnerable. This ‘frame date’ can be central to how one plays the game, especially at a high level. A familiarity is recommended, at least with the character one plays the most (Munday <a href="#Munday 2016" target="_blank" title="Munday J (2016) Gief’s gym: a guide to Street Fighter V">2016</a>:257). For example, Sakura’s standing light punch in <em>Street Fighter V</em> (Nakayama <a href="#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>) has 4 frames on startup, 3 active and 8 recovery compared to her standing heavy punch which has 9 frames on startup, 3 active and 21 recovery (Capcom <a href="#Capcom n.d." target="_blank" title="Capcom (n.d.a) Frame List | SAKURA">n.d.</a>).</div>
<figure>
	<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/584613290?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" id="Figure 12" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Sakura punch 2.mp4"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
	<figcaption class="small"><a href="#RFigure 12" target="_blank" title="Full citation for captured footage (new tab)">Figure 12</a>: Sakura's standing light and heavy punch (frame data)</figcaption>
</figure>
<div>The latter does more damage but requires more startup and recovery frames and is therefore less safe. This vulnerability can be overcome, however, by using combos – linking certain attacks together so that the proceeding attack connects to or interrupts the recovery frames of the attack before it. Frame data also plays a role in ‘frame trapping’ which is to create a situation where an opponent’s attack can be interrupted with a counterattack that has fewer startup frames (Munday <a href="#Munday 2016" target="_blank" title="Munday J (2016) Gief’s gym: a guide to Street Fighter V">2016</a>:260). Though it is not essential, familiarity with frame data can make frame trapping possible in many situations. Thus, character animations in Street Fighter come to have meaning beyond the illusions of movement. In many ways, understanding the animations as illusions is important to comprehend the mechanics of the game. </div>
		
<div>But frame data rarely transcend the spectacle of the cinematographic illusion. Attempting to combo into a special attack means trying to complete the action within a set number of frames. The concept of individual frames is determining our actions, the frames are what occupy our thoughts above any complete Bergsonian notion of movement taken as an indivisible whole derived from intuition. During a match, however, any consideration of separate frames will be brief; the mind will only temporarily dip beneath the surface of the illusion before being thrust back into the spectacle of a complete Spinning Bird Kick. This means that an awareness of the cinematographic illusion and taking advantage of certain scenarios through a knowledge of the same, does not undermine the effects of the illusion during gameplay. An awareness of the illusion increasingly comes to determine how we play as our skills improve despite a lagging perception that remains subject to the illusion. Players do not count frames in real-time during a match, character animations are only manipulated as illusions of movement. Frame data plays an important role in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of one’s chosen character in certain situations. The game’s developer, Capcom (<a href="#Capcom n.d." target="_blank" title="Capcom (n.d.a) Frame List | SAKURA">n.d.</a>), makes all of <em>Street Fighter V</em>’s (Nakayama <a href="#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>) frame data available on their website and certain tools in that game’s training mode are designed to facilitate a comprehension of frame data while practising.</div>

<div>While none of this is essential to play or even win the game and one enviably learns how to exploit the limitations of the game’s systems over time through gameplay, frame data notwithstanding (Munday <a href="#Munday 2016" target="_blank" title="Munday J (2016) Gief’s gym: a guide to Street Fighter V">2016</a>:256-257), playing the game conditions actions to be partially determined by the fact that the animations in the game are not real movements. For example, it is possible to learn through trial and error that special attacks can interrupt recovery frames.  This phenomenon is only possible because the animations are finite and divisible. Exploiting this fact does not entail cheating or breaking the game but the exact opposite, that is how one plays and even wins the game. So, concerning what is perceived as movement in-game, to win at <em>Street Fighter</em> one needs to unlearn what movement is according to natural intuition. This will be comprehended not only intellectually but through the body, through muscle memory that superposes a formal knowledge of frame data.</div>

<div>What is perceived as movement in <em>Street Fighter</em> is a finite series of still images and extracting that illusion is a process not far removed from scientific inquiry. Outside videogames, to modify real movement or intervene in an action from one’s own body or that of another, we already divide movement artificially (Bergson <a href="#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/1907</a>:191-192). This process of division can go on forever indefinitely in scientific inquiry, never getting any closer to real movement (Bergson <a href="#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>:214-215). However, the illusions of movement in <em>Street Fighter</em> are phenomena scientific thought can get to the bottom of, which is exactly what one must do to improve at the game. The animations are divided into sections to intervene in an action but unlike real movement, this process has an end. The ceiling is rapidly reached, and no further divisions are necessary, the inquiry is complete. A clear definite division separating cause and effect can be easily located. Thus, the future can be grasped in its entirety. The production of the new, its ever upspringing, can be stayed and we can win the game.</div>
		
<div>This is what happens in a combo string. Because the movements are not real and the number of frames is finite, the effect of a cause can be locked in until the string of connected attacks is over. There is no frame gap in which the opponent can intervene a counter, the number of possible actions their avatar can perform has been reduced to zero. At the start of a match, possible false movements orbit each player’s character in a virtual plane. (By ‘virtual’ we do not mean that which is computated but the whole from which potentialities are actualised; see Deleuze <a href="#Deleuze 1996/2018" target="_blank" title="Deleuze (1996/2018) Bergsonism">1998/2018</a>:60). There is potentiality surrounding the character, multiple pathways present themselves before they are forced to coalesce into a single point, a single animation or illusion of movement. A match in <em>Street Fighter</em> can thus be described as a series of fluctuations, with the number of potential actions expanding and shrinking. Each player is attempting to force the virtual lines into a single point that is a win state for them. This is accomplished through an understanding of the movements as illusions, as was described above in the form of frame data, to enable frame trapping and strategic combo strings.</div>
		
<div>In <em>Street Fighter</em>, autonomy is what generates real movement; agency mobilises still frames through creative unforeseeable gestures. Finite parameters constitute the strategic elements of the game and the deeper the grasp one has of these, the more meaningful, intentional and autonomous one’s actions in the game become. The creative comprehension and manipulation of finite significations is an indivisible movement towards a win state.</div>
		
<div>This indivisible path or real movement could so far be described as centred, framed via a description of how to win the game or a single player’s experience with a computer, pushing towards a singular outcome. But the actual event of the videogame image is an acentred movement because there are multiple agencies working, dialogically and in conflict in any videogame instance, including single player. Below I will examine the constituents of a <em>Street Fighter</em>match as a shared becoming, a single creative event.</div>

	<h3 id="2.9"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.9</a> The Dialogic Image (a)</h3>
	
<div>To play <em>Street Fighter</em> is to participate in a kind of inter-human dialogue, which is both visual and kinesthetic. During a match, the actions of the opponent, displayed on the monitor, can be regarded as a series of questions that demand a response. These should not be thought of as literal questions, only as impetuses which are directed at the player and which demand action. These questions would lose all meaning if the player was absent, they are what it means to play the game and participate in Street Fighter as an act of dialogue. Responses are, in turn, also questions to an opponent and what is shared in this mutuality constitutes the novel dialogue of the game. This is only made possible through the unique visual language of illusions of movements provided by the game’s developers via the apparatus.</div>
		
<div>This dialogue is irreducible, however, and the separate elements of question and answer can mislead us from this fact. The question precedes the response in time, it anticipates a response, but the question has not become fully actualised, its full meaning and implications do not emerge until after the answer has been given.  The question to which the action was a reply becomes suddenly more apparent, it becomes real. But an answer is also a question and that question will be constantly renewed, taking on new meaning and becoming mobilised in the unfolding events of a match. This new meaning cannot be predicted just as an opponent’s emerging response will continue to introduce new and unforeseen elements. The dialogue itself is not located in the back and forth motion of question and answer. It happens in neither the question nor the answer, not in one player or the other or the developer’s anticipations. It is, following Buber (<a href="#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>; <a href="#Buber 1965" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1965) The knowledge of man">1965</a>) here, in the in-betweenness of the participants.</div>
		
<div>We can come closer to understanding the shared creative act of a <em>Street Fighter</em> match by furthering this resemblance to Buberian dialogue and borrowing some distinctions Buber (<a href="#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:10-12) made, namely ‘observing’, ‘looking on’ and ‘becoming aware’.</div>

<div>We are ‘observing’ when we play against a dummy in the practice mode of <em>Street Fighter V</em> (Nakayama <a href="#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>) which has been programmed to perform a series of moves in a desired sequence. But dialogue will never emerge from our interaction with this dummy, its animations will be learnt in a rote manner and only ‘observed’ (Buber <a href="#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:10). That is, we can accumulate recognisable traits and patterns that can be memorised and this can play an important part of what is required to improve one’s skills at anticipate the sequence of moves we have programmed, but this only points towards and cannot replace the dialogic act of playing a match where indetermination extends beyond us into an otherness.</div>

<div>A deeper understanding can come from becoming what Buber (<a href="#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:10) calls ‘the onlooker’. Here, we disregard any attempt to learn individual elements, remember or even acknowledge them. The phenomenon is taken as a whole, as a single impression. We say to ourselves, ‘I will not try to “figure out” my opponent in a deliberate and calculated way, I will seize the advantages that come from skipping all that, looking passed separate elements or instances at something more complete’. This gesture, like observing, plays an important role in the process of learning the game and winning a match. There is a general awareness that only comes from prolonged experience with the game, which also applies to the non-specific comprehension of an opponent. While this can bring us closer to the human or object that is our subject in many ways, we have not yet arrived at the kind of awareness and state that is only made possible through dialogue.</div>
		
<div>This ‘becoming aware’ (Buber <a href="#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:12) is identifiable in <em>Street Fighter</em> because the actions of my opponent in the game, the questions described above, are all to me. What is being displayed on the monitor ‘speaks something that enters into my own life’ and demands my immediate action (Buber <a href="#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:11). In the previous two kinds of awareness, the human or object I am seeking to comprehend is separate from me but in <em>Street Fighter</em> ‘this man is not my object; I have got to do with him’ (Buber <a href="#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2004</a>:11). A film or book can say things that feel unique and personal based on my interpretation of the text, but it is only an interpretation; what is unique in videogames, the novelty that is emerging, is shared between us at that moment and is incomplete. This is a novelty that we become aware of because we are part of its emergence.</div>
		
<div>In Street Fighter, the fact that there are win and lose states distracts us from the dialogic nature of the phenomenon. The competitive nature of the game does not inhibit dialogue. Competition entails more than setting one’s opponent at a distance from oneself to establish difference — I won, you lost. For Elias (<a href="#Elias 1978" target="_blank" title="Elias N (1978) What is sociology?">1978</a>:130), player interdependence can entail both ‘an interdependence of allies or of opponents’ and our use of Buber (<a href="#Buber 1965" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1965) The knowledge of man">1965</a>:69) here paints the latter as acceptance of otherness:</div>
<blockquote class="small">…man learns not merely that he is limited by man, cast upon his own finitude, partialness, need of completion, but his own relation to truth is heightened by the other’s different relation to the same truth.</blockquote>
<div>In a <em>Street Fighter</em> match, we are confronted with the paradox of an alternative interpretation of the same truths, the same finite game mechanics, which are yet not the same, and cannot be controlled or predicted. This phenomenon amounts to something of a violence on our person, on that distance presupposed, an attack on the objectification of the other,</div>	
<blockquote class="small">…each becomes aware of the other and is thus related to him in such a way that he does not regard and use him as an object, but as his partner in a living event, even if it is no more than a boxing match. (Buber <a href="#Buber 1965" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1965) The knowledge of man">1965</a>:64) </blockquote>
<div>A distance is present before a match begins, and a distance is established by the outcome of the match, but these facts should only throw into relief what is mutual during the match itself.</div>

2.10</a> The Violent Image (a)</h3>

<div>The spectacle of violence can distract from the dialogic event we have just described. Consider a more extreme example like <em>Mortal Kombat</em> (Boon <a href="#Boon 2002" target="_blank" title="Boon E (director) (2002) Mortal kombat: deadly alliance [videogame]">2002</a>, <a href="#Boon 2004" target="_blank" title="Boon E (director) (2004) Mortal kombat: deception [videogame]">2004</a>, <a href="#Boon 2006" target="_blank" title="Boon E (director) (2006) Mortal kombat: armagedon [videogame]">2006</a>, <a href="#Boon 2008" target="_blank" title="Boon E (director) (2008) Mortal kombat vs. DC universe [videogame]">2008</a>, <a href="#Boon 2011" target="_blank" title="Boon E (director) (2011) Mortal kombat [videogame]">2011</a>, <a href="#Boon 2015" target="_blank" title="Boon E (director) (2015) Mortal kombat X [videogame]">2015</a>, <a href="#Boon 2019" target="_blank" title="Boon E (director) (2019) Mortal kombat 11 [videogame]">2019</a>; Boon and Tobias <a href="#Boon 1992" target="_blank" title="Boon E and Tobias J (designers) (1992) Mortal kombat [videogame]">1992</a>, <a href="#Boon 1993" target="_blank" title="Boon E and Tobias J (designers) (1993) Mortal kombat II [videogame]">1993</a>, <a href="#Boon 1995" target="_blank" title="Boon E and Tobias J (designers) (1995) Mortal kombat 3 [videogame]">1995</a>, <a href="#Boon 1997" target="_blank" title="Boon E and Tobias J (designers) (1997) Mortal kombat 4 [videogame]">1997</a>), a series of two-dimensional fighting games famous for their gruesome depictions of violence. In Mortal Kombat 11 (Boon <a href="#Boon 2019" target="_blank" title="Boon E (director) (2019) Mortal kombat 11 [videogame]">2019</a>) Cassie Cage’s defult <em>fatality</em> entails kicking her opponent in the chest so hard it punctures their body, sending their heart across the arena. In <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, the opponent’s avatar becomes a piece of meat that is played with for laughs in a variety of ways to celebrate victory.</div>

<div>It must be acknowledged that this spectacle is completely at odds with the entering into relation that dialogue entails. What once represented an opponent has become a dead object to be controlled. There is no mutual confirmation of an alternative truths to be reconciled. Here, the violent image ignores the contradiction of the other. But these images are not what will inevitably come to determine one’s actions in a match. We can conceive of instances when a particular move is performed for the sake of how it demonstrates dominance over an opponent, but <em>Mortal Kombat 11</em> (Boon <a href="#Boon 2019" target="_blank" title="Boon E (director) (2019) Mortal kombat 11 [videogame]">2019</a>) requires a strategic application of the illusions of movement in the same way <em>Street Fighter</em> does. These rapidly come to determine the one’s actions more than the visual appeal of the illusions of   movements themselves, graphics or violence. The last of these stands out, because of how violence seems most clearly at odds with what is generally perceived as productive dialogue. But illusions of movement in general, or any gesture towards realism can also be construed as a type of violence against the irreducible because everything becomes its object. The next level will explore the violent image in more detail, in relation to the image event.</div>

2.11</a> The Dialogic Image (b)</h3>

<div>This description of <em>Street Fighter</em> as dialogue frames videogames around the Bergsonian philosophy of the new. There are unprecedented game-states that the developers could not have anticipated — they can only create fences. Though the computer contains, in its programming, a finite list of our possible actions, it cannot predict what our next action will be. It can only take a catalogue of all previous actions; it can only become along with us. In videogames we participate in a new instance of movement, real novelty, because to play a videogame is to be more than a consumer, it is to participate in a mutual becoming, which works to produce the image.</div>

<div>Humans participate together to form a videogame image in a shared movement and this does not exclude the apparatus. One can have a dialogical encounter with a piece of nature or art or whenever we become with an object, where it ceases to be an object for us, and we slide together into an in-betweenness. This phenomenon, in the case of videogames, can be observed in a very literal sense. There is a shared dependency between the human and the apparatus to perform a mutual transformation. The thing that is evolving resides in neither party alone but is a literal coming together, a single movement like Bergson’s (<a href="#Bergson 1896" target="_blank" title="Bergson H (1896/2004) Matter and Memory">1896/2004</a>:285) description of perception. When we play <em>Street Fighter</em> and are not pulling ourselves out of the act of play through deliberate objectification of the game or an opponent, the threshold separating subject and object disappears. This is the case even while playing alone against the computer. Our movements become the illusions of movement on the screen, but now they are real, for there is no definite threshold.</div>

<div>In multiplayer, a creative event shared between player, developers and hardware is what enters into relation with another human opponent to form another image, another possible framing of an irreducible event. In this instance it is even harder to decern or justify a dialogic centre and in one sense the event becomes more real or that decisions have more interpersonal weight. Playing Street Fighter against another person is, for most people, always preferable. There is a realness to the movements, even while playing against a stranger online, that is absent against the computer or against what the game’s development team have anticipated. We could describe multiplayer as a dialogue between two players that is mediated by a machine and developers, like two dialogues entering into a third dialogue. But this suggests that there are multiple creative acts happening simultaneously, which is misleading. We can artificially distinguish separate elements, separate dialogic gestures, but the shared becoming itself should ultimately be regarded as a single human event – where parameters lose meaning.</div>

<div>This shared becoming between humans and machines is further complicated when we consider a temporally offset dialogue happening between players and game developers. With a computer, the developer lays out a finite plane predicting and responding to every possible action from the player, enabling and restricting, expanding and shrinking possible actions. To then play the game entails cutting a path through that finite plane, replacing the possible with the potential, the finite with the virtual. We are never playing a videogame by ourselves because there is a constant and indirect collaboration with the developers to create the emerging image event. What makes this exchange irreducible and dialogic is that the path itself cannot be foreseen because of player and developer agency – except a temporal dissonance makes mutuality uneven. The contents of the plane prior to the game’s development cannot be predicted, for developing a game is its own creative act. However, the game’s gesture is incomplete until it is actioned by a player and when a player performs an action the developer’s response has literally already taken place. Player and developer mutually depend on each other in shared production of the new.</div>

<div>This final dialogue between the developers and the players serves to show how many different elements are being brought into relation in the event of a Street Fighter match. We can artificially isolate separate dialogical instances of mutual becoming, one between the human and the apparatus, another between two humans in the moment of a match and another between the player and developer. These disparate participants should be regarded as converging elements that form a single creative and social event. While Goffman (<a href="#Goffman 1967" target="_blank" title="Goffman E (1967) Interaction ritual: essays on face-to-face behaviour">1963</a>:17) extended the scope of social situations to encompass ‘physical copresence, tele-phonic connection or letter exchange’, there is both an immediacy and potentiality to videogames which makes them unique. The player enters into a becoming where agency is central, but there is also a kind of submission to larger pre-planned transformations. The emergence taking place is based on a mutual inheritance which has already partially happened and yet remains unresolved.</div>

<div>Notwithstanding the technical feat involved in the broad phenomenon that is Street Fighter and the extent to which it has been created in this respect, by virtue of the coalescence of multiple dialogic elements, it remains fundamentally a becoming that is facilitated by technology. Like Handelman’s (<a href="#Handelman 2005" target="_blank" title="Handelman D (2005) ‘Introduction: why ritual in Its own right? how so?’">2005</a>) picture of ritual, <em>Street Fighter</em> and other videogames can be assigned their own autonomy and are thus independent happenings. This has a tendency of being masked when we are distracted by the spectacle of the apparatus itself in a quantitative pursuit of realism or violence.</div>

	<h3 id="2.12"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.12</a> The Animated Image</h3>
		
<div>I have used the word ‘animation’ above, along the way of describing the dialogic event which produces a videogame image with specific reference to <em>Street Fighter</em>. Animation can also be regarded as a separate medium, distinct from both cinema and videogames, but here I will regard it as a means or method which can be employed in cinema or videogames in the process of producing an image. Another method, is this regard, would be the camera or the gamepad, or unreal engine. Animation is a means of producing an image, of generating frames. Videogames players work with developers and artists, in a small capacity in terms of labour but in a large capacity in terms of the decisive last instant which chooses the next frame, to produce an animated image.</div>
		
<div>Animation is not an essential feature of videogames. The videogame event employs animation for what it can lend to the image. We can see this in the history of Japanese role-playing games like <em>Final Fantasy</em> (Ito <a href="#Ito 2000" target="_blank" title="Ito H (director) (2000) Final fantasy ix [videogame]">2000</a>; Kitase <a href="#Kitase 1997" target="_blank" title="Kitase Y (director) (1997) Final fantasy vii [videogame]">1997</a>, <a href="#Kitase 1999" target="_blank" title="Kitase Y (director) (1999) Final fantasy viii [videogame]">1999</a>, <a href="#Kitase 2001" target="_blank" title="Kitase Y (director) (2001) Final fantasy x [videogame]">2001</a>; Kitase and Ito <a href="#Kitase 1994" target="_blank" title="Kitase Y and Ito H (directors) (1994) Final fantasy vi [videogame]">1994</a>; Komoto <a href="#Komoto 2010" target="_blank" title="Komoto N (disigner) (2010) Final fantasy xiv [videogame]">2010</a>; Sakaguchi <a href="#Sakaguchi 1987" target="_blank" title="Sakaguchi H (director) (1987) Final fantasy [videogame]">1987</a>, <a href="#Sakaguchi 1988" target="_blank" title="Sakaguchi H (director) (1988) Final fantasy ii [videogame]">1988</a>, <a href="#Sakaguchi 1990" target="_blank" title="Sakaguchi H (director) (1990) Final fantasy iii [videogame]">1990</a>, <a href="#Sakaguchi 1991" target="_blank" title="Sakaguchi H (director) (1991) Final fantasy iv [videogame]">1991</a>, <a href="#Sakaguchi 1992" target="_blank" title="Sakaguchi H (director) (1992) Final fantasy v [videogame]">1992</a>; Tabata <a href="#Tabata 2016" target="_blank" title="Tabata H (director) (2016) Final fantasy xv [videogame]">2016</a>; Takai <a href="Takai n.d." target="_blank" title="Takai H (director) (n.d.)

Here is a battle sequence from each major entry in the franchise, from 1987 to 2016:</div>

</figure>
<div>We can see the number and extent of animated elements increase as such opportunities present themselves through advancing technologies. Animation is inserted or applied to the specific instances of gameplay where it has something to contribute. If it is applied with excess, this can have an impact on game design and gameplay; it can affect the possibilities of unfolding dialogue. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is worth noting again here, for how it attempts to reconcile the recreation of nostalgic and familiar game elements in in a way that also fulfils current AAA expectations pertaining to animation. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> behaves like a standard 3D action game until the ATB (active time battle) gauge is full. Then the action can be paused for players to strategically select more powerful attacks, items or spells. Only, the animations have not paused entirely, gameplay is effectively paused but the animations still move in very slow motion which creates the feeling of passing time, as we can see here:</div>
<figure>
	<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/578881107?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" id="Figure 16" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="ATB (Active Time Battle) in FFVII Remake"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

</figure>
<div>There is a refusal here to return to the static images of the franchise’s early instalments and animation lends itself to the conveyance of an unfolding event, an event that has always been present even when full animations were impossible. The slowdown in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is the animations acquiesces to larger gameplay agendas, a compromise between conflicting dialogue styles. The animation can lend itself to the videogame event, to conveying the image as an event, but it must just as frequently yield to gameplay. This submission has been described as a point of good game design. Animation is the crux where developers communicate a game’s most important information, the possibilities of the unfolding image, to the player. This was described above in the case of <em>Street Fighter</em>; start-up frames are an intrinsic part of game design in fighting games. They are also an essential element of fighting game animation because they are necessary for communication, for the developer to communicate the possibilities of the image to the player, for the player to communicate and accommodate for their opponent’s recognition of their intentions, the broadcasting of their choices within the image itself. Videogames have facilitated a particular animation style which fulfils the needs of dialogue. For example, in <em>Rayman 2</em>(Ancel <a href="#Ancel 1999" target="_blank" title="Ancel M (director) (1999) Rayman 2: the great escape [videogame]">1999</a>) we can see traces of the feeling of gameplay in the animations of Rayman, the playable character. Rayman feels fast and snappy because the player can initiate the jump at any moment: from the middle of a role, from hanging on a ledge, the moment Rayman’s feet touch the ground we can jump again. <em>Rayman 2</em> displays an animation style that accommodates for the spontaneity of dialogue, where the next frame, as a decision takes priority in the unfolding event. For, the image also belongs to the player and not just the sprite animator.</div>

<div>I first read Deleuze’s (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>, <a href="#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>) cinema books while I was learning how to play <em>Street Fighter V</em>. I took notes in the margins and underlined passages which seemed to conflict with, or reveal certain aspects of, the phenomenon of the fighting game I had immersed myself in. I can recall one, perhaps imagined case of Deleuze mentioning animation in that readthrough but have since been unable to locate it. ‘Animation’ does not appear in the index of <em>Cinema 1</em> or <em>Cinema 2</em>. I opened the PDF of each book – the object on my shelf has become an event on my monitor full of potentialities. I perform an orC (optical character recognition) scan using <em>Adobe Acrobat Pro DC</em> (Adobe <a href="#Adobe 1993" target="_blank" title="Adobe (1993) Adobe acrobat [software]">1993</a>) on the PDF document to convert it into searchable text, press Crtl + F, type ‘animation’ and press enter. Between the two books there is only one instance of that word occurring (though it is possible the orC failed to recognise particular instances like, for example, if the word animation were spread across two lines with a hyphen). That single occurrence of ‘animation’ is in an endnote on page 230 in reference to Vertov (citen in Deleuze <a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:230). Deleuze has no interest in animation and my reading of the text with a mind preoccupied with frame data and character animations was not to extract a theory of animation that can be applied to the cinema; I was thinking about videogames via the cinema in a way that is similar to how this level commenced, leveraging the theoretical and conceptual maturity of ideas about an entirely different medium to stimulate original thought by challenging them in a new mode foreign to them.</div>

<div>Animation in and of itself is not problematic for Deleuze’s (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>, <a href="#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>) concepts of the cinema. We can take an animated film and easily identify within it whatever varieties of movement-image we can decern, ignoring the fact that these images have been accomplished through animation. What animation does for the cinema, takes place along a different line of thought. Brad Bird (<a href="#Bird 2018" target="_blank" title="Bird B (2018) 'Why Incredibles 2 director says cartoons aren't just for children' [video]">2018</a>) was asked in an interview to comment on the recent Disney adaptations (Branagh <a href="#Branagh 2015" target="_blank" title="Branagh K (director) (2015) Cinderella [motion picture]">2015</a>; Favreau <a href="#Favreau 2016" target="_blank" title="Favreau J (director) (2016) The jungle book [motion picture]">2016</a>, <a href="#Favreau 2019" target="_blank" title="Favreau J (director) (2019) The lion king [motion picture]">2019</a>; Ritchie <a href="#Ritchie 2019" target="_blank" title="Ritchie G (director) (2019) Aladdin [motion picture]">2019</a>) of their classic animated films like <em>Cinderella</em> (Geronimior et al. <a href="#Geronimi 1950" target="_blank" title="Geronimi C, Luske H and Jackson W (directors) (1950) Cinderella [motion picture]">1950</a>), <em>The Jungle Book</em> (Reitherman <a href="#Reitherman 1967" target="_blank" title="Reitherman W (director) (1967) The jungle book [motion picture]">1967</a>) <em>The Lion King</em> (Allers and Minkoff <a href="#Allers 1994" target="_blank" title="Allers R and Minkoff R (directors) (1994) The lion king [motion picture]">1994</a>) or <em>Aladdin</em> (Musker and Clements <a href="#Musker 1992" target="_blank" title="Musker J and Clements R (directors) (1992) Aladdin [motion picture]">1992</a>) into live action – What is being accomplished in this retreat from animation in pursuit of realism? Bird’s response came to the defence of animation as ‘it’s own thing’ vis-à-vis images of movement captured through a camera. Photorealism, as provided by the camera, ‘…is not the reason to do animation anyway, the reason to do animation is caricature’. On these terms, animation is more than the reduction of an image into its essence, it is the enhancement of those faculties which make it distinct, specifically pertaining to movement. This caricature of movement can be implemented and lend itself to the cinema or the videogame but in each case, it is fulfilling a different need, contributing to a different event. Animation serves the cinema in reference to narrative and character, and though these are still relevant factors in how a game tells its story, animation in the videogame also must communicate to everyone involved in the event the possibilities and outcomes of the image as a dialogic event.</div>

	<h3 id="2.13"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.13</a> The Dialogic Image (c)</h3>
		
<div>One of my first naive goals for this project, in the early stages of its conceptualisation, was to describe real movement in <em>Street Fighter</em> à la the movement-image Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>, <a href="#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>) identified in cinema. The failure of this intention is what bore fruit, revealing how radically different the videogame is from the cinema. For it seemed that, according to Deleuze’s (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>:24) analysis of primitive cinema, <em>Street Fighter</em> ought to entail the cinematographic illusion par excellence. But <em>Street Fighter</em>, and videogames more generally, need to be regarded as an entirely separate phenomenon with a radically different essence so as to make this connection invalid. If we take player agency to be the fundamental gesture of interactive media (developers are players too), the image is immediately mobilised according to the same Bergsonian definitions of movement Deleuze employed, albeit in a completely different way.</div>
		
<div>If videogames are regarded as events with their own evolving autonomy, we must acknowledge that they are unique and unprecedented in this regard. Their finite elements often include the generation and navigation of a spatial plane along a set of predetermined parameters, but in Street Fighter we have shown that these parameters can harbour infinite significance when their conception becomes the object of human striving and when they are integrated into the irreducible gestures of dialogue. The multifaceted nature of the event also makes it unique; videogames entail a creative evolution that is shared between disparate parties including the human, the non-human and the temporally displaced human. These coalesce in a single unpredictable moment that is its own autonomous event. Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>:280) regarded filmmakers as philosophers, he did philosophy with the cinema, but videogames need to happen to anthropology. That is, they need to emerge for us as human events which take place within the process of producing an image. Videogames are presently interhuman and in them we can see the emerging human; a videogame is produced as an event, not an object.</div>
		
<div>This understanding of the videogame as an image, which only actualises in the event of its production, will meet resistance because software, as a general phenomenon, hides the event, framing itself as an object.</div>

2.14</a> <strong>Interlude</strong>: Software and the Problem with Digital Objects</h3>

	<h4 id="2.14.1"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.14.1</a> Free Software and <em>GNU/Limux</em></h4>
			
<div>Since software has been distributed and sold as a finite commodity, the Free Software Foundation has fought to protect user’s rights in relation to it. Their ethical stance is connected to a more general construal of software which regards it as a special type of object. On their website they explain:</div>
<blockquote class="small">Software differs from material objects — such as chairs, sandwiches, and gasoline — in that it can be copied and changed much more easily. These facilities are why software is useful; we believe a program's users should be free to take advantage of them, not solely its developer. (Free Software Foundation <a href="#Free Software Foundation 2018a" target="_blank" title="Free Software Foundation (2018a) 'Philosophy of the GNU project'">2018a</a>:para.3)</blockquote>
<div>This understanding of software as a digital object is foundational to their human rights project, which is founded on utility. The user must be able to ‘take advantage’ of the properties that make software unique. Software is a thing to be manipulated, to have control over, and like any tool it must be ‘useful’. Anything less than complete access to and control over the source code, prevents instrumentation. Proprietary restrictions obstruct the user’s ability to make software an object for them, to penetrate it, comprehend it and change how it works. In a mechanistic understanding of the universe, every object can and ought to be understood and controlled, including software. Thus, ‘free software’ refers to user agency; it is, ‘…a matter of liberty, not price’ (Free Software Foundation <a href="#Free Software Foundation 2018b" target="_blank" title="Free Software Foundation (2018b) 'What is free software?'">2018b</a>, para. 3). Such is the basis of the Free Software Foundation’s ethical and moral stance in relation to software.</div>
			
<div>This stance both emerges from and motivates an intimate knowledge of software and a competence in its manipulation. Those responsible for the Free Software Foundation, particularly Richard Stallman, display these traits in the various achievements attached to the organisation. The most notable of these is <em>GNU/Linux</em>.</div>

<div>The <em>GNU</em> project started in 1983 with Stallman’s (1983 cited in Williams <a href="#Williams 2012" target="_blank" title="Williams S (2010) Free as in freedom (2.0): Richard Stallman and the free software revolution">2010</a>:89) announcement:</div>
			
	<blockquote class="small">Starting this Thanksgiving I am going to write a complete Unix-compatible software called GNU (for Gnu’s not Unix), and give it away for free to everyone who can use it.</blockquote>
				
<div>By 1991 Stallman and other contributors had developed and released much of a complete operating system (OS), apart from a working kernel (Smith <a href="#Smith 2012" target="_blank" title="Smith RW (2012) Linux essentials">2012</a>:8). Linus Torvalds' (<a href="#Torvalds 1991" target="_blank" title="Torvalds (developer) (1993) Linux [software]">1991</a>) <em>Unix</em> (Thompson et al. <a href="#Thompson 1973" target="_blank" title="Thompson K, Ritchie D, Kernighan B, McIlroy D and Ossanna J (developers) (1973) Unix [software]">1973</a>) compatible <em>Linux</em> kernel was combined with the <em>GNU</em> tools to create <em>GNU/Linux</em>, a fully functioning OS capable of replacing <em>Windows</em> (Microsoft <a href="#Microsoft 1985" target="_blank" title="Microsoft (developer) (1985) Windows [software]">1985</a>) or <em>MacOS</em> (Apple <a href="#Apple 2001" target="_blank" title="Apple (developer) (2001) macOS (software)">2001</a>) (Stallman <a href="#Stallman 2019" target="_blank" title="Stallman R (2019) 'Linux and the GNU system'">2019</a>:para.5). <em>GNU/Linux</em> is also capable of meeting every criterion outlined above for ‘free software’, though this will depend on which distribution has been installed and whether the user has opted to download proprietary drivers.<em>Arch Linux</em> (Polyak <a href="#Polyak 2002" target="_blank" title="Polyak L (lead developer) (2002) Arch linux [software]">2002</a>) is one distribution which is growing in popularity for its enactment of the utilitarian values outlined above and I will be returning to it later in this interlude.</div>

<div><em>GNU/Linux</em> has become the platform of choice for many users on two grounds, which converge. The first is utility. Many find <em>GNU/Linux</em>, and other software associated with it like <em>Emacs</em> (Moon and Steele <a href="#Moon 1976" target="_blank" title="Moon DA and Steele Jr. GL (original authors) (1976) Emacs">1976</a>), to be more powerful. There are seemingly infinite levels of customisation all the way down to the OS kernel, if one has the knowledge and ambition. GNU/Linux is the epitome of what Chun (<a href="#Chun 2008" target="_blank" title="—— (2008) ‘On Sourcery, or Code as Fetish’">2008</a>:300) describes as ‘the valorization of the user as agent’. This connects to the second ground, namely ethics. Free software means ‘users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software’ (Free Software Foundation <a href="#Free Software Foundation 2018b" target="_blank" title="Free Software Foundation (2018b) 'What is free software?'">2018b</a>:para.3). All these become possible in <em>GNU/Linux</em> while in <em>Windows</em> (Microsoft <a href="#Microsoft 1985" target="_blank" title="Microsoft (developer) (1985) Windows [software]">1985</a>) and <em>MacOS</em> (Apple <a href="#Apple 2001" target="_blank" title="Apple (developer) (2001) macOS (software)">2001</a>) often almost none of them are. Both grounds are tied to an epistemological stance, which I will trace to Descartes (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) and which places the good within a process of disengagement and control. Good productive humans are in control of their environment and of themselves. For this to be realised, one needs access to the bottom of things, i.e. the source code. It must be a possibility for the user to know everything constituting the object in question — to have these paths open is both good and practical.</div>

2.14.2</a> Digital Objects (a)</h4>
			
<div>Before continuing the level '<a href="#2" target="_blank" title="2 Dialogue: The Videogame Image">Dialogue: The Videogame Image</a>', I will problematize the notion of digital objects, as they are framed by the Free Software Foundation and the various projects attached to it, specifically <em>Arch Linux</em> (Polyak <a href="#Polyak 2002" target="_blank" title="Polyak L (lead developer) (2002) Arch linux [software]">2002</a>) and a programme designed for the <em>GNU</em> operating system called <em>Emacs</em> (Moon and Steele <a href="#Moon 1976" target="_blank" title="Moon DA and Steele Jr. GL (original authors) (1976) Emacs">1976</a>). This is to explore the paths which are closed to the human being in relation to software when it is regarded as an object as opposed to the event (what I have been associating with the videogame image). This interlude will, of course, have implications that extend beyond the <em>GNU</em> project, into the rest of this document and beyond. For, the treatment of digital objects is a widespread phenomenon. That it is conveniently and expressly stated in the Free Software Foundation’s rhetoric is one reason for my attention to it here. This is in the service of a broader discussion that needs to be had regarding software and the way it is researched.</div>
			
<div>The existence and value of digital objects is based on epistemological premises. Understanding what these premises are should be a precondition for any study into software and its relation to humans, but it is also essential to the more basic problem that is stating what software is in the first place. One cannot set out to describe a digital object without picking up a great deal of epistemological baggage — and I do not claim to be entirely immune of this either. One must conform to a particular way of knowing and the good in order to ask the question. This has been a neglected issue in the academic literature, not because the discourse on software materiality has almost been abandoned (see McKeown <a href="#McKeown 2018" target="_blank" title="McKeown C (2018) ‘Playing with materiality: an agential-realist reading of SethBling’s Super Maria World code-injection’">2018</a>:1235), but because the premises that make software coherent, regardless of its materiality, have gone unexplored. My goal here is to make a start on that process through a description of <em>GNU</em> software as an emerging inter-human event.</div>
		
	<h4 id="2.14.3"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.14.3</a> Graphical User Interfaces</h4>

<div>It is easy to attribute this construal of software – that is to regard it as a special type of object – as something inherent to graphical user interfaces (GUIs), stepping over the epistemological conditions that frame it entirely. That a list of commands can be made visible and graphically represented on a screen as a potentiality, the same way a sandwich sitting on the table is a potentiality, contributes to how quickly most of us accept a description of the pictures on a monitor as 'objects'. 'These objects... can be made visible or invisible through the configuration of the system' (Hui <a href="#Hui 2016" target="_blank" title="Hui Y (2016) On the existence of digital objects">2016</a>:1), popping in and out of existence as virtual lines or pathways. These paths are described and marketed to the user as physical objects, as metaphors, so they are immediately understood. The ‘desktop’ is where I arrange the items I am currently working on; the ‘file system’ is where my ‘documents’ are stored. And this is all a very natural and understandable way of describing how computers work, one that developers and programmers comply with and are largely responsible for, e.g. the founding <em>Unix</em> (Thompson et al. <a href="#Thompson 1973" target="_blank" title="Thompson K, Ritchie D, Kernighan B, McIlroy D and Ossanna J (developers) (1973) Unix [software]">1973</a>) idea that ‘everything is a file’ or object-oriented programming. Metaphors aside, if we were not so accustomed to GUIs it would be less obvious to describe a string of commands as a ‘digital object’.</div>
			
<div>Thus, the obvious explanation for the direction of OS development, as it has moved from the command line to the desktop environment or GUI, is that software has been made to resemble the way we already interact with physical objects. Computers have become visual because the way humans have evolved to interact with their environment is based on visual cues. It is easier for a person to deal with a complex list of commands, if those commands are represented on a monitor as an icon with a name. This is to ‘hide a whole machine from its users’ (Kittler <a href="#Kittler 1995" target="_blank" title="Kittler F (1995) ‘There is No Software’">1995</a>:para.12) in a way that has become fundamental to how computers operate, and not even <em>GNU/Linux</em> has been able to escape this act of deception. For the software must be usable for the neophyte and this is accomplished through a GUI. When proprietary software does not close users off from parts of their machine, lack of knowledge and the sheer convenience of graphical interfaces will.</div>
			
<div>But all this only points to the type of object software is, ignoring what it means for software to be regarded as an object in the first place. We know there is something more behind the ‘images pulsing from the screen’ (Chun <a href="#Chun 2006" target="_blank" title="Chun WHK (2006) Control and freedom: power and paranoia in the age of fiber optics">2006</a>:4), for digital objects behave in a fundamentally different way to their physical counterparts. So, we have all gotten very used to thinking with metaphors. An object does not have to be physical to be ‘real’ and making this point in the context of computers has been one of Boellstorff’s (<a href="#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>; <a href="#Boellstorff 2014" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2014) ‘An afterward in four binarisms’">2014</a>; <a href="#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>) priorities. But there is an obviousness to this that makes it almost unnecessary. Things like money, as Boellstorff (<a href="#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:387) notes, or even the words I am writing now must be real in some sense. Kittler (<a href="#Kittler 1995" target="_blank" title="Kittler F (1995) ‘There is No Software’">1995</a>) was one of the few with a commitment to realism strong enough to reject this in his influential essay, ‘There is No Software’, but we need to move the discussion away from the realist/nominalist dilemmas. This is because regardless of where an author locates themselves on that spectrum, they always start from the digital object and make an attempt to grasp it.</div>

	<h4 id="2.14.4"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.14.4</a> Digital Objects (b)</h4>
			
<div>The digital object is a problem to be solved. For many researchers, ‘Software is, or should be, a notoriously difficult concept’ (Chun <a href="#Chun 2011" target="_blank" title="Chun WHK (2011) Programmed visions: software and memory">2011</a>:3). It is like the question of being, ‘For indeed we all know many beings, but what being itself is, or what it is to be, is an extremely obscure and intricate question’ (Gilson <a href="#Gilson 1948" target="_blank" title="Gilson É (1948/1961) Being and some philosophers">1948/1961</a>:7). This can be likened to the digital object and how it is often regarded. For it demonstrates and makes necessary a particular orientation towards the world which conditions the questions posed to it, albeit in a way that occludes its essence.</div>
			
<div>For example, in many ways, software is the cultural object par excellence because it makes social constructivism tangible and obvious. The ‘meta-medium of the digital computer’ houses ‘cultural forms’ from which we can construct a genealogy of our time (Manovich <a href="#Manovich 2002" target="_blank" title="Manovich L (2002) The language of new media">2002</a>:6). But the digital object is also seen as something too strange for that, functioning ‘on a profound level of “sorcery”’ which remains hidden (Chun <a href="#Chun 2008" target="_blank" title="Chun WHK (2008) ‘On Sourcery, or Code as Fetish’">2008</a>:300). Regardless, whether software is revealed via ‘historical-cultural and technical narratives’ (Frabetti <a href="#Frabetti 2015" target="_blank" title="Frabetti F (2015) Software theory: a cultural and philosophical study">2015</a>:xix) or is the manifestation of a ‘computational agency’ in ‘incomputable objects’ (Parisi <a href="#Parisi 2013" target="_blank" title="Parisi L (2013) Contagious architecture: computation">2013</a>:87,163), it is encountered as an object in the first instance and, for that reason, all these explanations move within a particular epistemological context. The problem of software, as an object, is only a problem within the theoretical space where software makes sense to us and where it is useable.</div>
			
<div>Just as many philosophers have found being to be a problematic starting point — hence Heidegger’s (<a href="#Heidegger 1927" target="_blank" title="Heidegger M (1927/2008) Being and time">1927/2008</a>:36) indirect path via Dasein — software will never reveal itself without an external disruption.  A novel entry point into the human event of software needs to be identified. Like being, software would then be a becoming which cannot be objectified or separated from ourselves without severing its essential parts. But this is not a step many have been able to embrace in regard to software due to a preoccupation with the problem of the ‘digital object’ itself.</div>

	<h4 id="2.14.5"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.14.5</a> Anthropology and Digital Objects</h4>
			
<div>The nature of anthropological investigations into software also demonstrate this. Anthropologists have generally failed to see software as an inter-human event, instead regarding it as a potential field-site, provided a platform meets certain criteria. As was mentioned above, we see this in the discipline’s focus on ‘virtual worlds’ as opposed to other digital phenomena. For example, Boellstorff (<a href="#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>; <a href="#Boellstorff 2014" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2014) ‘An afterward in four binarisms’">2014</a>; <a href="#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>) often differentiates virtual reality and software in general from ‘virtual worlds’, painting the latter as ‘persistent contexts of social immersion’ (Boellstorff <a href="#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:395), ‘alternative realities’ with real social and political import. Boellstorff (<a href="#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:387) insists upon virtual world’s social reality, and thus their value as topics of inquiry for anthropologists and social scientists. But this social reality hinges on how software is being used by humans as a distinct object; ‘a flight simulator run from a single computer not connected to the internet… is not a virtual world, because it disappears when the computer is turned off’ (Boellstorff <a href="#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:395). Anthropology has no interest in software itself as a human event, only in its function as a social platform hence the strong focus on digital ethnographies (see Hine <a href="#Hine 2015" target="_blank" title="Hine C (2015) Ethnography for the internet: embedded, embodied and everyday">2015</a>; Miller <a href="#Miller 2016" target="_blank" title="Miller D (2016) Social Media in an english village: or how to keep people at just the right distance">2016</a>; Nardi <a href="#Nardi 2010" target="_blank" title="Nardi BA (2010) My life as a night elf priest: an anthropological account of World of Warcraft">2010</a>). These ethnographies describe what software is doing to people, how it is changing human experience, sociality and expression. Again, the division here between human and software is based on an understanding of the latter as an object to be understood, as a strange new location where the potentialities of the human are being reconfigured, e.g. ‘the social media landscape’ (Miller <a href="#Miller 2016" target="_blank" title="Miller D (2016) Social Media in an english village: or how to keep people at just the right distance">2016</a>:19).</div>

	<h4 id="2.14.6"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.14.6</a> Digital Object as Event</h4>
			
<div>To problematize software’s treatment as a discrete object it cannot be our starting point. Such is the framework taken up in the above examples and the particularities of their various arguments have little bearing on the key issue, which lies in the abstraction of software in the first place. Deleuze and Guattari’s (<a href="#Deleuze 1991" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G and Guattari F (1991/2015) What is philosophy?">1991/2015</a>:21) pursuit of the concept is a similar notion to the one I am making here: ‘The concept speaks the event, not the essence or thing… It is like the bird as event’. Likewise, we are moving towards a notion of software as human event, not as a thing with an essence that can be described. One means of doing this is to unmake software-the-object by showing it to be the product of certain epistemologies which also determine the grounds on which it has been examined. This context even informs our moral systems, understanding of the good and sense of self, which can not only be identified in the Free Software Foundation’s articulation of software and a person’s rights in relation to it, but even in academic spheres we see these forces at work as they frame the questions posed in relation to software and the means by which it is addressed. For, a great many unarticulated premises are involved in the gesture of treating software as a special kind of thing or problem in the first place.</div>
			
<div>The way software is engaged with in the above examples moves like classical realism in how it starts from the object; the existence of a digital object is the presupposition and condition of engagement. But while starting from the digital object resembles and feels like classical realism in this sense, it is more fundamentally idealist. This is because the natural inhibitions all of us have towards realism, based on our experience with physical objects, work differently when applied to software. Kittler (<a href="#Kittler 1995" target="_blank" title="Kittler F (1995) ‘There is No Software’">1995</a>) was one of the few true realists in relation to software, when he reduced it to a ‘transformation of matter from entropy to information, from a million sleeping transistors into differences between electronic potentials’. But all this requires an unnatural way of thinking and abstraction atypical to realism.</div>

	<h4 id="2.14.7"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.14.7</a> Cartesian Abstraction</h4>
			
<div>This is because the digital object presupposes a Cartesian abstraction which has already taken place. In order to think like Kittler (<a href="#Kittler 1995" target="_blank" title="Kittler F (1995) ‘There is No Software’">1995</a>), one has to work backwards to undo the epistemological context that is thrust into our minds every time we look at a computer screen. This is why software, as an object, always leads to further abstraction, a more fundamental abstraction has already happened in order for the object to exist at all. McKeown (<a href="#McKeown 2018" target="_blank" title="McKeown C (2018) ‘Playing with materiality: an agential-realist reading of SethBling’s Super Maria World code-injection’">2018</a>:1239) observed this in an exploration of code injection in Super Mario World:</div>
<blockquote class="small">Greater Knowledge of “the game” revealed that it was simply a series of instructions and activities that could be manipulated and distorted. Knowledge did not give rise to solidity but vaporiness.</blockquote>
<div>Thus, software becomes an elusive and strange object that defies classical instrumentation aligning with the empiricist tradition. The experience of software, as a digital object, can only exist for an abstract self, a user, that is treated as separate from it. However, even a superficial understanding of the phenomenon reveals its dependence on a specific human condition. When it comes to software, we are all Cartesians.</div>
			
<div>One response to this might be to question my specific association with Descartes (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) and the empiricist tradition he inspired. For example, this could be done with Bergson’s (<a href="#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>:349) argument that, ‘Science is not… a human construction. It is prior to intellect, independent of it, veritably the generator of Things’. Thus, digital phenomena are only imitating a process that is fundamental to the human condition and there is no reason to specifically associate it with Descartes. Software is the performance of a more general human phenomenon which takes place every time a person reflects on the nature of things and perception in a general sense. Dipping in and out of this kind of awareness is what it means to be in the world. When we are in a task, we do not perform this abstraction. When we experience movement, we make no attempt to grasp it, for doing so destroys it, but we all still know what movement is. Thus, abstraction is an element of human nature that is more basic than Descartes’ ideas, however broad their influence. Why can software not then be attributed to an instance of this basic human inclination? It should be – in the same way Descartes’ philosophy is an enactment of it too. But Descartes is still part of a broader trajectory we need to appreciate to understand software as a human event. It is the way perception and the body are being played with here, in the phenomenon in question, that is at issue. It is the prioritization of utility and radical reflexivity resulting in a specific kind of abstract self that needs to be identified in software. We can do this by unmaking the digital object through its association with Cartesian philosophy.</div>
			
<div>Descartes (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) set the starting point within the intuition of thought and we have not left it. The creative evolution of software has been to give thought an object that it can become, or, rather, it is thought’s or the self’s struggle to turn itself into an object. As was explained above, though starting from the digital object resembles realism, it is to follow Descartes exactly. For, Descartes ‘was in intention a realist’ and software is a continuation of that trajectory (Gilson <a href="#Gilson 1935" target="_blank" title="Gilson É (1935/2011) Methodical realism">1935/2011</a>:‘Methodical Realism’). Thus, software is an epistemological problem. It is not a mysterious thing to be understood but a way of knowing or stance the human has adopted towards the world. It is an instance of the human, a human event.</div>
			
<div>Software parallels Descartes’ (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) broader innovation to regard a process, namely the self, as an object. Descartes, the mathematician that he was, saw in those disciplines ‘which deal only with the very simplest and most general of things’, like arithmetic and geometry, that is, disciplines that can work with imagined objects, something beyond doubt. Though the wax is not perceived with the senses, in the ‘sweetness of the honey, or the fragrance of the flowers’ it is perceived nevertheless as ‘an inspection of the mind alone’ (Descartes <a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>). Then, everything becomes a question of process and one must no longer enquire into what a particular thing is, but the way it has been perceived by the mind. Descartes instigated a rationality that ‘is no longer defined substantively, in terms of the order of being, but rather procedurally, in terms of the standards by which we construct orders in science and life’ (Taylor <a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:156). Taylor draws a comparison between Plato’s model and Descartes’ innovation: ‘For Plato, to be rational we have to be right about the order of things. For Descartes rationality means thinking according to certain canons’ (Taylor <a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:156). With Descartes, the issue is no longer turning oneself towards the correct good, but the process by which one finds the good. The process itself is brought into question.</div>
			
<div>However, as Descartes (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) himself was keenly aware, it is not easy to consistently think in this way. Descartes (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>:23) reflects on how ‘a kind of laziness brings me back to what is more habitual in my life’, thus it is a process which must be seized and controlled:</div>
<blockquote class="small">My mind likes to wander and is not yet willing to stay within the boundaries of the truth. Let it be and allow it once again to be completely unconstrained so that soon afterwards, when the constraints are reimposed, it will find it easier to be directed. (Descartes <a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>:27)</blockquote>
<div>Thought itself has become the object to control and understand. Software, then, as a beneficiary of Descartes’ model, can be viewed as both a demonstration of the objectification of the process that is thought, as well as a means of expressing and accomplishing that instrumentation.</div>
		
	<h4 id="2.14.8"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.14.8</a> Arch Linux</h4>
			
<div><em>Arch Linux</em> (Polyak <a href="#Polyak 2002" target="_blank" title="Polyak L (lead developer) (2002) Arch linux [software]">2002</a>) can demand a great deal from the user due to its involved installation process. This is an attractive feature for many because it allows for extensive customization while also serving as something of a rite of passage into the <em>Arch Linux</em> community. Every user on the <em>Arch Linux</em> subreddit has at least enough knowledge to have installed the operating system in the first place, which has led to a passionate and knowledgeable community. This installation process involves creating and formatting the necessary disk partitions, mounting the file system, installing packages and a bootloader, creating users and setting permissions.  This must all be done manually in the terminal; there is no GUI with things to click on, the user must know what commands to type. Most people will eventually install a desktop environment or window manager to make using the computer easier, though there is a minority of users who prefer to remain in the terminal.</div>
			
<div>Every step along this process of installation involves a Cartesian instrumentation which depends on a radical reflexivity. Like doing a mathematical equation, constructing an environment of digital objects involves a retreat from the sensory world. It is true that creating and formatting disk partitions entails some physical change in the computer’s hardware, but it also involves a kind of objectification of thought. Users need to consider, at this very early stage, what they are planning to use the machine for: What thought events need to transpire in this conceptual space I am constructing? That will influence how large, for example, the swap partition should be, because one needs a large swap for the computer to be able to go into hibernation. If this is not a priority, however, it could be a waste of space. These kinds of decisions are made all throughout the installation process. Users need to choose what kind of file system they want to use, what the user privileges will be, what programs to install and finally what kind of desktop environment or window manager will best suit their needs. In short, they are creating a space for a special kind of mental labour that will take place, a labour that is entirely separate from the world of sense. Software is not the performance of pixels for our senses. That is only the conduit through which we gaze into a world of Cartesian detachment, which is premade and pre-abstracted. To build an OS is to map the terrain of that world, to plot out, in advance, the possibilities of thought. For, an OS exists to automatize the distribution of computer resources (Kothari et al. <a href="#Kothari 2015" target="_blank" title="Kothari DP, Vasudevan SK and Subashri V (2015) Linux">2015</a>:1). That is, to make certain thoughts and events possible through the unprecedented ability to perpetuate the alterations of detached Cartesian thought. We make ourselves, our ideas, our metaphors and, in the case of <em>Arch Linux</em>, our operating systems. The self is being partitioned and its parameters are being drawn out in the creation of an OS, for the event of an isolated thinking self(selves) is what an operating system is.</div>
		
	<h4 id="2.14.9"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.14.9</a> Cogito Operating System</h4>
			
<div>This isolated self is an instance of radical reflexivity, for it is being separated, even from itself and becoming an object for itself. The building of an OS is a process of separation through abstraction; the user and machine are being teased apart through the automation of computer resource distribution. A culmination of this process of separation is the creation of a user account. Very few people use their computer solely in root because it is dangerous. One might accidentally delete or alter an essential file. Users need to be separated from sensitive files with passwords and individual log-ins. Even if only one person will ever use a computer, they still need an account with distinct permissions and changing how the computer works requires users to go into root or use ‘sudoers’.  Thus, the human is an enemy to the complex functioning of a computer and a barrier of sorts needs to be constructed to preserve smooth operation. The GUI and user accounts are manifestations of this necessary separation. This is a performance of the separation Descartes (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) presents in <em>Meditations</em>, which results in a self which is distinct and separate from the entire world of sense.</div>
			
<div>In this way, the computer not only speaks to a user, it frames a cogito. Software cannot exist without it and all objects on screen are the event of the user participating in the process of making themselves and construing thought as an object. Software, as an event, is the process of framing a specific type of self. It both presupposes and enacts a cogito oriented towards utility. Writing code does not make software or digital objects, but is a process of Cartesian abstraction, which for a user has already taken place.</div>
			
<div>This generation of a sense of self is taking place any time we use a computer. <em>Arch Linux</em> is a useful example because in it we can see the intentional carving out of a self that the designing of an operating system entails. But this does not mean it applies any less to more popular operating systems like <em>Windows</em> or <em>MacOS</em>. The user boots up the machine as a user, skipping over some of the process of abstraction but there is still the initial instance of describing oneself, which establishes a distinct relationship with the computer.  The user puts their name, region, language, privacy settings etc., not to create some digital version of themselves, but to create a self, district from the machine, so that the machine can be instrumentalized, but also distinct from themselves so they can instrumentalize thought. It is a gesture of control, a gesture of instrumentalization in the most radical sense. Even when there is no explicit user account, everything moving on the screen, the dialogue that is taking place, presupposes an individual orientated towards utility. This is true if the user is using a computer on the surface level or writing code to change how software performs. The colour of the icon is not in the icon itself but the code, which can be controlled by an abstract self. This instrumentalization is valued as an essential element of the self, which connects to self-expression, disciple and control. The premise of all software is the empowerment of the user as agent via a Cartesian objectification of thought.</div>
			
<div>There is conflict surrounding what constitutes empowerment, but empowerment itself, as a value, is never brought into question. The Free Software Foundation champions a very specific conception of user empowerment that hinges on the user’s unlimited access to the source code. But this is not a concern for most people, who do not know, and are not interested in, what to do with the source code if it were given to them. Indeed, for many users, too many options actually inhibit their freedom and they are left feeling disempowered. Regardless, there is a consensus surrounding an ethics that is centred on control. To deprive a human of that control is to withhold some fundamental right.</div>
			
<div>And here we can identify some of the sources of <em>Arch Linux</em> rhetoric. For, while the wiki describes <em>Arch</em> as ‘a pragmatic distribution rather than an ideological one’ (Arch Linux <a href="#Arch Linux 2021" target="_blank" title="Arch Linux (16 July 2021) Arch linux wiki">2021</a>:Pragmatism), the whole appeal of Arch, and GNU/Linux distributions like it, is that the user, to varying extents, builds or customizes it themselves. This aligns perfectly with the moral values often associated with empiricist traditions we associate with Descartes (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) and also Locke. For Locke (cited in Taylor <a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:167), ‘The floating of other Mens Opinions in our brains makes us not a jot more knowing, though they happen to be true’ , and there is likewise less value in a software when the user plays no role in its becoming. Just as the ideas of someone else do not really belong to me until I have gone through the necessary mental procedures to validate it for myself, a pragmatic approach to software should facilitate the user’s apprehension and control of software in the most fundamental way. This also aligns with the Free Software Foundation’s imperative, which is to enable users to use software rather than be used and controlled by it.</div>

2.14.10</a> Emacs</h4>
			
<div><em>Emacs</em> is the epitome of Stallman’s (<a href="#Stallman 2019" target="_blank" title="Stallman R (2019) 'Linux and the GNU system'">2019</a>) vision of what free software that respects its users ought to be. Science fiction author, Neil Stephenson (<a href="#Stephenson 1999" target="_blank" title="Stephenson N (1999/2007) In the Beginning… Was the Command Line">1999/2007</a>:‘OS Shock’), describes it this way:</div>
<blockquote class="small">I use emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear word processor… the engineer-hours that, in the case of Microsoft Word, were devoted to features like mail merge, and the ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate memoranda, were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively simple-seeming problem of editing text.</blockquote>
<div>The prospective <em>Emacs</em> user should be forgiven for wondering what is lacking in this most basic of computer tasks. For the average user does not meet a great deal of resistance when they set out to put words on the screen. <em>Emacs</em> will make this resistance a reality with a steep learning curve and with the promise of greater freedom on the other side. The program is well equipped to deal with writing complex bodies of text, for its main use is as a text editor for writing code. Much of this, as Neil Stephenson and many other writers have found, translates well to the task of writing prose more generally. This is described as a process of learning how to use the software and this description turns on the notion of the good empowered human who is in control, who can seize an object and make what they want out of it, even when that object is themselves. That is, the user must make themselves in order to take control of the software. Learning how to use Emacs is a process of self-development.</div>
			
<div>This will become clearer if we detail the typical movements that take place in Emacs as an emerging human event. <em>Emacs</em> is presented as a text editor designed for writing code, discrete for its customizability and extensibility. This is the appeal that might lead someone to participate in the evolving human event that is the software.  Like all the <em>GNU</em> tools, <em>Emacs</em> represents an attempt to undermine the typical power structures inherent in software between developer and user. This is accomplished by demanding a great deal from the user. The software environment necessitates a high level of competence and to use <em>Emacs</em> effectively, the user must construct a workflow by editing config files, assigning and memorizing numerous key bindings and coming to terms with the design logic that has governed <em>Emacs’</em> development since its inception. This logic moves on the premise of expanding utility and explains why, at this stage, <em>Emacs</em> can be used to do almost anything from planning a project to surfing the internet or playing games. None of these possibilities, however, will be evident to the new user.</div>
			
<div>If someone downloads the software with the intention of using it for creative or academic writing (as many do), it is likely that they will feel profoundly confused and powerless when they first open the program. After seeing a page that says, ‘Welcome to GNU Emacs’, the user might be left wondering why there is no option to create a new document, or what a ‘buffer’ is. When they finally get a blank screen to type words on, they might feel a profound absence of customisation options and conclude the promised empowerment of Emacs is a lie.  Eventually they decide to read the manual, learn about major and minor modes, that for their purposes they need to switch to ‘org mode’ and start reading an entirely separate manual specific to that mode. Simple things that are normally taken for granted in a word processor, like the cursor automatically moving to a new line, might take an entire afternoon to resolve (this was my experience), especially if one is unpractised in stating the problem in the language of <em>Emacs</em>.</div>
			
<div>The user is transformed through their participation in the event that is the software. Their comprehension and appreciation of the power of Emacs is proportional to their becoming with it, indeed this should be regarded as an arbitrary distinction.  Emacs is an act of framing a particular kind of Lockian self that is disciplined and self-developed. I say it is Lockian because of the way Locke (<a href="#Locke 1689" target="_blank" title="Locke J (1689/2001) An Essay Concerning Human Understanding">1689/2001</a>) pushed Descartes’ (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) disengagement further to the point of self-remaking. For Locke (cited in Taylor <a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:170), the will is entirely determined by an ‘uneasiness of desire’. That is, our actions are reactions to the greatest discomfort and educating ourselves according to correct cannons can ‘change our pleasures, and give us a relish to what is necessary’ (Locke cited in Taylor <a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:171). There are necessary growing pains associated with learning Emacs, but the user will eventually come to enjoy and value these initial inconveniences as essential. The user comes to appreciate the utility of <em>Emacs</em>. It is not just about learning how to use the software but learning to want to do what is possible with it. In this way, software is a preestablished map for the possibilities of thought. Coming to terms with those possibilities entails the making of a new self, one that can more fully participate in the inter-human event that is the software.</div>

	<h4 id="2.14.11"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.14.11</a> Abstraction and Empowerment</h4>
			
<div><em>Emacs</em> and <em>Arch Linux</em> are expressions of an ambition to liberate the user via software. The continuing event of their becoming moves within an explicit rhetoric that construes software as a special kind of object that the human can use and control. My construal of them as events, linking them to and bringing into question a Cartesian epistemological context, is a reaction to that rhetoric.</div>
			
<div>I regard software to be an anthropological issue, for it is a shared becoming and evolution of the potentialities and possibilities of the human. No single person is the author of <em>Emacs</em> or <em>Arch Linux</em>. All the contributors are also users. The melting away of the distinction between developer and consumer is another reason I have chosen to focus on software associated with the Free Software Foundation. Proprietary software only adds another layer to prevent us from realising software in general to be an enactment of epistemological and moral ideas. But now that we have shown free software to be a human event, it necessarily follows that all software is. The further implications of the consumerist and capitalist contexts of both free and non-free software will need to be picked up elsewhere.</div>

<div>What I find more pressing however, is the need to move our discussion beyond the historical sources of ideas that have been identified here. It is one thing to uproot the Cartesian sources of the broad human phenomenon that is software, as they pertain to unarticulated epistemological and moral stances, but this reading must then be used to gain leverage for a new and creative interpretation of the same. If we allow this analysis to rest on a historical or genealogical explanation, then we have made even less progress than those whose central focus is the digital object. Software will have been reduced to a simple enactment of enlightenment ideas, taken to their extreme, occluding the creative and evolving event that it is. Cartesian abstraction and Lockian self-making were only able to be identified from without, via a rejection of the digital object as a premise. This identification has served to further open the possibilities of thought towards software as an inter-human event and, as such an event, software manifests internal defiance’s to these models, which can now be thrown into relief.</div>
			
<div>We have seen that software not only generates an abstract self but apprehends and plays with the irreconcilability of the mind body problem. The self is both objectified and asserted simultaneously as we engage with the apparatus. It is both autotomised and liberated via a seizure of perception enabled by the GUI. We give ourselves to the sceptical of the machine and are at the same time apprehended by it in ways that have not yet been fully appreciated. A rasterized digital object spins before my eyes and though I contemplate the pixels, refreshing display or electronic circuitry of the central processing unit, making hundreds of millions of calculations per second to produce the illusion of an object based on mathematical equations – the object is there, it has taken my body, and I cannot help but behold it.</div>

2.14.12</a> Dialogues and Assemblages</h4>
	
<div> To participate in a software event, a person concentrates their attention on a panel of flashing lights while holding a divice or while resting their hands on a table, over a mouse and keyboard. There needs to have been at least one developer, which is the person who has anticipated this, the user's posture. Between the user and developer, we can isolate two more elements: hardware and additional software. Concerning hardware, we might describe what its design and commodification contribute to the event in question. With additional software – e.g. the operating system, development tools, drivers, etc. – the event becomes more cumbersome to represent and analyse. This is because each software instance, once considered, creates a new developer vis-à-vis user situation. A multitude of people – development teams with directors, designers, artists, programmers, etc. – are usually involved and manifest in the image. They have anticipated and responded to this labour performed by the user or player. In this way, each choreographed and automated computer process that is necessary for the gaming event to occur forms an overwhelmingly complex and genealogical matrix. A complete description of this mere experience – picks up the smartphone, ‘I'm going to book an Uber’ – entails a detailed history of computing, untangling the authorship of layers of code from binary to JavaScript, directed entirely at the conveyance of a singular image, with all its particularities – that time I went to airport.</div>
	
	<h3 id="2.15"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.15</a> </h3>

<div>Computer graphics, whether they are rasterized or ray-traced, are an instance of the human body being captured in a complex relationship between developer, user and device. We have already explored how this dialogic event unfolds and some of its elements. It remains, in this section exploring the videogame image, for us to make clear the role a device plays in that event. This can be called the dialogue between a user and a device. Because the divice (a monitor, television, smart phone, Gameboy Advance, Neo Geo Pocket, etc.) is a component of the dialogic event I have been describing, we must not regard it as the sole giver of digital images. This is why I will not refer to the images in question as 'computer generated images'. The image is the byproduct of an event in which the computer and screen are constituents.</div> 

<div>The device's function in said event is not to 'trick perception' via the generation of a digital image which resembled elements of the natural world. The experience of the digital image cannot be seperated from other, more fundimental elements of the event like user and developer intentionalities. The images we feel we 'receive' from our displays are already distinct from the objects we say they represent. Of course, we are aware of this detail of the event; we know we are looking at a divice. But the image is also <em>percieved</em>. That is, it transpires on a level that is prior to thought or conscious reflection. Viewing a digital image does not require a specific kind of intentional thought but a specific set of bodily assumptions. These assumptions can be summarised as the giving of one's body over to the event. Put differently, the human experiences an embodied and dialogic relationship with the image, which is contextualised and dependent on a broader situation rooted in the physicality of the device and its meaning; i.e., I sit at my desk and turn on the computer, I put the VR headset over my eyes, I pull my phone out of my pocket and get into position, I orient the screen in relation to my body and go through these pre-perceptual manoeuvres to <em>allow my body to be captured</em>. The device's function in the event is to capture our bodies. The image is not in the device; the device does not produce an image.</div>

<div>The body is not captured by realism attributed to the image but is captured via this aforementioned performance with a device. I do not see a tree outside only to later discover it is a rasterized image. I might mistake a rasterized tree on my phone for a photo, but that is only my assigning the wrong imaging technology to a particular case; I always knew it to be an image of a tree on my phone. More than that, <em>my body performed and percived it as an image on my phone, even before I knew it</em>. Even so, I marvel at the photorealism of the rasterized tree but I am really celebrating the event and what it is doing, seemingly involunterily, to my body. This transpires on two levels:
<ol> 
	<li>My conscious participation in the image event (I searched 'trees' in Google Images) colides with my inability to articulate what is missing from the image, contextualisations nothwithstanding, that would make it the perception of a real tree;</li>
	<li>My body's participation in the image's origins colides with the divices ability to stimulate lines and styles familiar to the natural world (i.e. the shape of a tree).</li> 
</ol>
Both these conflicts affirm the instrumentalization of the body and lead to a feeling of it being played with.</div>

<div>Below we will see how videogame graphics can demonstrate this more effectivly than Google Images because the videogame industry values realism enabeling technologies like ray-tracing beyond aesthetics and for the sake of user participation. Ray-tracing does not merely look good; it <em>feels</em> good to perform on/with the screen. The developer, player and device aspire to cast and trace some rays. I participate in this event with my body and unintentional, but welcome, things are happening to my body — or to perception — because I am not the only actor.</div> 

<div>And this is all to show that computer graphics are not an illusion, which is obvious, but derive value from (1) the way they demonstrate popular Cartesian philisophical stances pertaining to the instrumentalisation of the body and (2) the way they represent the stimulation of the body by an apparatus prior to thought, which will both require more elaborations. These can start with what Merleau-Ponty (1945/2012:32) said concerning colour:</div> 
<blockquote class="small">The first perception of colors, properly so called, is thus a change in the structure of consciousness, the institution of a new dimension of experience, and the deployment of an a priori. </blockquote>
<div>And the same can said of pixels performing said colour in new ways, like ray-traced reflections in a puddle on the streets of Night City in <em>Cyber Punk 2077</em>:

2.16</a> Seeing a Rasterized Mountain</h3>
		
<div>I am staring at a landscape on my monitor. There are mountains and trees, and a cloud is flouting through the sky in front of one of the mountains:</div>
<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/644189342?h=9193796d02&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="looking at a rasterized mountain"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
<figcaption class="small"><a href="#RFigure 19" target="_blank" title="Full citation for captured footage (new tab)">Figure 19</a>: Staring at a Rasterized Mountain</figcaption>
<div>I know this image has been generated by my computer and I make an effort to not see it. That is, I try to enforce an additional abstraction on top of what has already been given, to replace the mountains, trees and clouds with an array of pixels changing colour. They change colour according to a process called rasterization, which works by starting with an object - like a mountain or a cloud - and placing that object on a grid that represents the computer monitor.  Algorithms interject, for example, to alter the colours of the pixels according to which object is in front of another, like a cloud floating in front of a mountain. Thus, I am only looking at a set of pixels changing colour sixty times per second to resemble an image of a mountain.</div>

<div>However, my goal is to do more than merely think about pixels and rasterization while I stare at the screen. My intention is to no longer see the mountain or cloud at all. Some are more practiced at achieving this extreme form of abstraction than others. For example, artists train themselves to paint realistic depth and colour through a kind of optical localisation. One might wonder why someone paints the grass of a scene red until later, when more of the image is composed and the soft glow of the setting sun across a landscape becomes clear. There is no red grass in the final image, only the sun’s light affecting the whole scene. Once the image is complete – the painter has finished, and we have successfully given our bodies to it – to see the red grass again one must remove oneself from the whole and make an additional abstraction after the event of perception. Likewise, on my computer screen, I cannot escape the final product and un-see the mountain at base; I can only add additional predicates to the initial experience of it. In this sense, the image has a certain hold on me.</div>

<div>Even the artist steps back once the picture is complete to appreciate the whole, to see it as a landscape and to behold what their process of abstraction has achieved, thereby giving themselves over to it. To never slip into perception’s immediately given would be to never see what the image is of, undermining the intentionality that is the condition for the image’s existence. Now that its composition is complete and we behold it, the mountain or landscape will henceforth be the premise of all thought concerning the phenomenon. We have, as Merleau-Ponty (1945/2012:32) just described for us, 'the deployment of an a priori'.</div>
	
	<h3 id="2.17"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.17</a> Phenomenology of a Rasterized Image</h3>
		
<div>The above observations are based on Merleau-Ponty’s (<a href="#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>) conviction that embodied perception is the transcendental precondition of consciousness. 

In contrast to the rasterized image, the apple sitting on the table is a part of the world the same way my body is a part of the world and I enter into a mutuality with that object which is dialogical. But the image, be it painted or rasterized, is the terminus of a more fundamental process of capture, the image exists for that sole purpose, and we are practiced at giving our bodies to this process. This is unlike the reticence shown in Walter Benjamin’s description of people viewing the first photographs; they did not like looking at the images which seemed so strange to them, they resisted giving themselves to the experience.</div>
		
<div>But it does not take long to get used to a photo or painting. It is easy to get to the bottom of it and see the process by which it came to be. One can lean in and see the brush strokes of a painting or fold up a photograph and put it in one’s pocket – the thing has been conquered, there is no further mystery. It is more difficulty to comprehend what I have given to the experience of the monitor; it is impossible to consistently comprehend the complex origins of the rasterized mountain on my computer screen. Unlike a painting, I am closed off from the genesis of the hold it has on me. The computer is performing the conditions of the immediately given and my body cannot outrun the mystery of the machine.</div>
		
<div>And this is all notwithstanding the strangeness of said mountain: the sharp lines and odd lighting which make it distinct from a photograph of a mountain, as well as the flatness, smallness and lack of bodily presence shared in the experience of both. In this respect, the rasterized image is even stranger than the photograph, though in neither case does perception give us the equivalent of a real mountain which we abstract afterwards to dispel illusion. Knowing the image is not ‘real’ does nothing to overcome the possession of one’s body in relation to it; the realness of the image is not what captures us. The image is not an illusion.</div>
		
<div>Dwelling on the particularities of a rasterized image only describes the type of experience we are having and does nothing to weaken the hold the image has on us. This should be obvious because of the broader embodied situation that is presupposed in the viewing of any image. We value the image for the way it is not real and the dominating stance this enables us to assume in relation to it. The image is a broken mountain that can be undone with the pulling of a thread, leaning in and breaking it further, but the next instance always provides a new broken mountain. Standing before mount Everest, the gravity and presence of its mass envelops one’s entire body. Leaning into the experience consumes the body further still and one becomes lost, or as Merleau-Ponty (<a href="#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>) might say, one ‘falls into’ the mountain. This does not describe our relationship with devices, I do not fall into the mountain on my computer screen, I fall into the monitor but the image of the mountain stimulates my body in such a way that it holds me, my body, at a distance – I marvel at what it is doing to me. To celebrate graphical fidelity is to applaud the spectacle of our bodies being played with. The image is part of a second-order world dependent on this more fundamental fact.</div>
		
<div>There is a dual nature to the episode that the whole body is geared towards.  The feeling of domination just described is tied to a gesture of submission. An infinite object, namely the self – the feeling of possession of one’s body – is given to a finite plane. What manifests itself as a strangeness upon reflection (e.g. broken textures, lighting or artefacts) is performed as a situation of empowerment connected to our comprehension of the limits of the image.</div>
		
<div>But this feeling of domination also makes us blind to the hold the image has on us. When the computer-generated image is regarded as an illusion, that is, something we can rationalise, this occludes what is irreducible in the event, what we have given to it and our inability to then escape it. The broken mountain has a ceiling that one rapidly collides with, which provides a kind of stimulation, interpreted as a conquering of the image but it is really the feeling of one’s body being taken over. In this sense, we give our bodies, our perception, over to this relation with an apparatus but do not comprehend the extent of our capture or what has captured us. For, we are transfixed and can only think the image while the object, i.e. the screen, and our relationship with it recedes from view.</div>
	
	<h3 id="2.18"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.18</a> Philosophies of the Image</h3>
		
<div>The above phenomenological description of the rasterized image is not an obvious one, even for phenomenologists. We see this in how the phenomenological tradition has been applied to digital media more generally. It has been made clear above, using Merleau-Ponty (<a href="#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:355), that we participate in the experience of the image with our entire bodies; ‘the body is the situation’. Perception is never isolated to a single sensory organ, but the entire body is geared towards intentionality. When discussing computers, there is a tendency to exclude the body from an analysis of what is transpiring on the screen. Dreyfus (<a href="#Dreyfus 2009" target="_blank" title="Dreyfus HL (2009) On the internet">2009</a>) famously employed Heideggerian philosophy to critique artificial intelligence and the internet, but this was mostly to bring two different understandings of reality up against each other. In this way Dreyfus’ work, importantly, has thrown into relief assumptions about human intelligence and the world tied to a rationalism that is foundational to the development of new technologies. But the development of artificial intelligence is not a phenomenological issue. To make it so, we must contextualise it as a manifestation of the philosophical traditions phenomenology was a reaction against – the philosopher needs an interlocutor.</div>
		
<div>A philosopher could do the same thing with this essay’s topic and present graphical realism as a philosophical demonstration; it has conquered perception with pure maths and physics and – to use Wittgenstein’s (<a href="#Wittgenstein 1953" target="_blank" title="Wittgenstein (1953/2009) Philosophical investigations">1953/2009</a>:53e) phrase – ‘a picture held us captive’. The popularity of simulation arguments based on projections of a virtual world indistinguishable from reality demonstrate the potency of this image and makes this association easy. Once this framing is set, computer-generated-images can be critiqued with any philosophy critical of Descartes <a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>, especially Heideggerian phenomenology.</div>
		
<div>A philosophical critique can detract from the value of the digital world, as Dreyfus (<a href="#Dreyfus 2009" target="_blank" title="Dreyfus HL (2009) On the internet">2009</a>) has shown, and one can use Merleau-Ponty (<a href="#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>) to vouch for the primacy of the body in these times of digital selves. These are the obvious philosophical paths to take in response to what recent technologies are accomplishing, to regard and respond to them as philosophical demonstrations of rationalist ideas. But this does nothing to think along with the event as a situated phenomenon. For, the rasterized image is ultimately an accomplishment of human bodies, it is the achievement of an image we can give our bodies to and become with. We must assume that perception has nothing to prove, it has already happened.</div>

	<h3 id="2.19"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.19</a> Anthropology of the Image Event</h3>
		
<div>But more than a phenomenological engagement, we can give computer graphics an anthropological one. This is because humans are responsible for the images we give our bodies to. I can feel infinity in my perception of a tree outside, in a way that is absent on my computer screen, because the image on my screen has a very specific and limited intentionality behind it and not because it does not have enough pixels. The premise of engagement with the rasterized image is to stimulate an initial perception, which invites an unveiling. The entire episode with a computer-generated-image is contextualised and anticipated around a particular belief in the possibilities of one’s participation in it. Merleau-Ponty (<a href="#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>) regards perception as an expression of primordial belief, that is, a faith or expectation in the world prior to thought. The baby extends his or her arm to grasp the object, not because their brain harbours some preconfigured map of the world, and neither is it the event of imagination based on a priori categories, but it is based on a kind of impulsive faith, not in anything specific, just in the fact that there is anything at all. To perceive the mountain on my computer screen, to enter into that event, also entails a belief in a world, one that is entirely the product of human ingenuity. However, we do not give ourselves to the author of a software the same way we give ourselves to the Other in dialogue where we confront and embrace the mystery of their being. Rather, we exercise a belief in a world, which presupposes a more fundamental world and the former’s function is to place a limiting factor on our bodies, prior to thought, and thereby entrap us. There is an uneven power distribution inherent in the dialogue unfolding and the world we express faith in is entirely predetermined by another human. (We will see below that this does not exclude software development that employs artificial intelligence or procedurally generated worlds). There is a fundamental finitude to the phenomenon capturing our bodies.</div>
		
<div>And before moving on we must note that this does not deem impossible something irreducible in the phenomenon of the rasterized image. So far we have only been concerned with the spectacle of the apparatus and technics of the image, which is the fundamental belief required for any creative innovations and inter-human events after that, which, of course, can be expressions of the irreducible human (as I have already explored elsewhere using Street Fighter as a specific example). The fact that these irreducible instances still occur should baffle us and be regarded as a miracle – not a miracle of technology, but the miracle of the human amidst every effort to contain and quantify it. This human event is an anthropological issue, but we must not exclude the body’s roll as the precondition for said phenomena. So, whatever creative human events transpire through the images on the screen (e.g. art, dialogue, relationships, societies), these are all couched in the body, devices and methods employed to create the image.</div>

	<h3 id="2.20"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.20</a> The Screen</h3>
		
<div>These devices and methods – which are foundational to the milieu of human computer-generated experiences – are being developed in ways that increase the hold a machine has on our bodies, not to make the image more closely resemble real life. Our interactions with devices are clearly embodied, but methods like rasterization and ray tracing (inter-human technics of capture in which a devise is made to point towards the event of the image, stimulating bodies in a way that leads to further stimulation) are too. These image technics, particularly ray tracing, will be considered below. But first we will consider human experience with an apparatus of capture, focusing on the device itself. In addition to the embodied relationship associated with our devices being more fundamental, such embodiment is also more obvious. For this reflection, we only need to bracket out our experience with the image to identify what our relationship with the device is doing to how we experience our bodies and the world.</div>
		
<div>This process reveals the direction of design innovations, what is marketed as immersive realism, to be a function which allows users to give more of their bodies – more of what is pre-reflective – to their relationships with their devices. This is manifest in the increasing screen size, decreasing thickness and disappearing bezels we are all familiar with in our phones, computers and televisions. The mode of capture comes to occupy more physical space in relation to our bodies. The parts of the device that could interrupt the giving of ourselves to the experience, that is, the experience of our bodies being played with and stimulated, becomes smaller and smaller until these disturbing parts have disappeared.</div>
		
<div>And there is a kind of nihilism in this too because the device is making the context of the image inaccessible to us; the workings of the machine are hidden from view. There is nothing but the image and our bodies. To whatever degree this image floating in space captures what is fundamental and pre-reflective in the person and the self, namely perception, it rejects any larger context and intentionality situating the person as being in the world. The human is then confined to whatever meaning is given them in the second-order world they have expressed belief in and submitted to with the device. This is not to say that we ever abandon what is at base, namely, the context of the spectacle, for that is a condition of engagement. That base is what makes the encounter stimulating because it constitutes the broader contexts which our bodies are capable of pretending to violate. This violation is eagerly anticipated in developing technologies through a great deal of faith and cultural history. The nihilism of the encounter shows the futility of its project, for without context the experience would lose all value – though, as we shall see, that is what makes it so exhilarating.</div>

2.21</a> The CRT</h3>
		
<div>For an example of this tendency of technological development, I will consider the CRT (cathode ray tube) monitor sitting on my desk. The CRT works by firing electrons from a cathode at the back of the monitor to the glass at the front. These types of monitors are old, heavy and take up a lot of desk space because they have to be deep – the electrons have to travel a distance to create the image. They were expensive to make and are difficult and potentially dangerous to dispose of. For the same reason it is not worth trying to repair one unless you are a professional. I found my CRT, a ViewSonic E70, dumped on the side of the road covered in mud. After bringing it home and seeing that it still worked, I put it on the desk in my office, right next to my 4k 28inch Samsung LCD. I found that there is something fundamentally different in the experience of using a CRT, opposed to an LCD, which extends beyond pure image quality.</div>
		
<div>And I should note that there are many passionate online communities who prefer CRTs and express their preference on the grounds of image quality alone. There is a higher perceived dynamic range; colours are richer and can be more accurate than an LCD; because there is no set number of pixels, they can scale to a larger variety resolutions and do so natively; images are softer, but this also means lower resolutions look better; from my experience, lower frame-rates appear smother, which seems to be because the monitor has both vertical and horizontal refresh rates – a single electron beam moves across and down the screen to create the image. Of course, nostalgia plays a role in CRT’s appeal today too, especially for playing retro PC games.</div>
		
<div>But there is also something more fundamental in the experience of using a CRT that is to do with the body’s relationship with the device and, as such, the event of the image being generated. The image is grounded in a weighted physicality, there is depth to it, not by virtue of colour depth for that only relates to the techniques of generating the image, but by virtue of the depth of the machine itself.  ‘It looks like you’re looking through a lens, like a piece of glass instead of a digital display’ (Linneman <a href="#Linneman 2019" target="_blank" title="Linneman J (December 7 2019) ‘DF direct: CRT displays - was LCD a big mistake for gaming?’ [video]">2019</a>:<a href="https://youtu.be/tvRyVZWuvQ4?t=328" target="_blank" title="Linneman J (December 7 2019) ‘DF direct: CRT displays - was LCD a big mistake for gaming?’ [video]">5’28”</a>) and more than that, in a way that feels like you are looking into another world.  The rounded glass at the front of the device is looked through into a beyond that has physical presence and which is unknown, lending mystery to the image. The size and weight of the monitor manifests itself in one’s immediate perception of the image being produced; the electrons fired from the cathode pass through a physical hidden cavity, which my body enters into a relation with, and is part of the initial framing of the image, prior to thought. What is nihilism in the flat Samsung panel, seeking to conceal all its inner workings in order to give our bodies an isolated image, becomes mystery that has meaning in the CRT– not necessarily for thought after the event of perception but before that, for the body and its relation to the world.  But here I am working against the direction of technological development, which is to remove such meaning from the body, to decontextualize perception, because this leads to greater stimulation. Of course, the CRT is stimulating too, but on very different grounds, especially when it is sitting next to another monitor that is only a couple of years old.</div>
		
<div>What is terrifying in the LCD is also exhilarating and this is tied to a belief in the second-order world which demonstrates the conquering of our bodies. Perception ceases to be a mystery amidst our faith in the isolated image. This image presents itself as existing independently of the world in which our bodies and perceptions are rooted. In contrast, the CRT’s image has a direct spaciality associated with it. The way the former seeks to undermine the body, prior to thought, demonstrates a kind of control that is quintessentially Cartesian. We are held by the image while marvelling at how such an instrumentation of our own bodies gives the illusion of control. In this way, we also practice refusing a part of ourselves, indeed, such a refusal constitutes our complex relationship with the image. We keep a portion back in order to marvel at what is taking place, to behold what is happening, seemingly involuntarily, to our bodies and to celebrate the accomplishment of technology this demonstrates.</div>

2.22</a> Second order World</h3>
		
<div>Software techniques like rasterization, discussed above, and ray tracing are constituents of this second-order world. They provide the potential for an unveiling of the image, which is empowering. If the monitor constitutes the embodied context of our experience with the image, software methods provide meaning within that world we have literally extended our hands towards, for, that extension is an essential part of perception. When considering graphical realism, we value the image because it is reducible. The conscious human has been present throughout its invention and the by-product of this awareness displaces thought away from the irreducible. As has already been stated, this does not mean the irreducible cannot occur in the event of the image, only that its context is regarded within finite conditions. Our bodies disappear for us in the event and the event’s meaning is associated with the world of action our bodies are geared towards. Ray tracing is an emerging conscious condition of that world.</div>
		
<div>When we arise in the morning, we assume there are objects and this assumption forms an inexhaustible field. When we turn on a computer, there are assumption tied to that action too, which form a finite field. It is a field bigger than anyone can count, but it is not infinite, for it is of a second-order. We experience it with our bodies because the body is the former world on which it depends and through which it has meaning. The computer-generated image is the effort of code to find its way back to, and equate with, our bodies. It does this by appropriating the expectations of our sense organs, not by tricking them that something is real. It stimulates the senses along preestablished routes that are the body’s conditions for being in the world. Those conditions are employed to form a new world, a new field of expectations and possible actions which will always be different from the body because it is of a second-order. All graphics asks the question: What colour should a pixel be to give the body the experience of a particular broken object?  But our experience of objects when we wake up in the morning is based on a more fundamental expectation and faith. Action precedes the object. And this is also a point made by Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1968" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1968/2014) Difference and repetition">1968/2014</a>) in <em>Difference and Repetition</em> in the form of difference preceding identity.</div>
		
<div>To ray trace an object for our bodies, rays are cast to simulate the behaviour of light and calculations are made, based on where those rays intersect with an object. But the object is always already there, even if the image has been randomly generated with AI, before rays are cast the existence of the object must be determined as either true or false. This need for facticity is a limiting factor on the digital world we point our bodies towards and is not an aspect of the natural world of perception described by Merleau-Ponty (<a href="#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>). To ask if a perception is real or not is a gesture of further abstraction which moves us away from the base of things. In the moment of perception, it is neither real nor false, that question is only possible after the foundation of the world has been established. A fundamental aspect our experience of the second-order digital world is this facticity, it is what makes the experience so peculiar and coming to terms with that strangeness is a process of education, building habits in our bodies that accommodate for a lack of infinity.</div>

	<h3 id="2.23"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
2.23</a> Adults vs Children</h3>
		
<div>This explains why the mistakes children make in relation to technology are so different to the mistakes adults make. The child and adult have the same amount of faith in the digital world, neither hesitate to give their bodies to it. But children expect that second-order field to harbour infinity and resemble the base of things too closely. My four-year-old son was playing <em>Mega Man X2</em> (Fujiwara <a href="#Fujiwara 1994" target="_blank" title="Fujiwara (1994) Mega Man X2 [videogame]">1994</a>) and at one stage a section of the tunnel collapsed, and he failed to move X out of the way. After trying and failing a few more times, I found him sitting with the controller on his lap, not moving the character on the screen at all. When I asked him what he was doing, he explained that he was waiting for the tunnel to collapse. He assumed an infinite world was moving and transpiring outside his view and that the collapsing tunnel was a part of it. Experience will eventually teach him that the obstacles are only generated to fulfil the parameters of the finite screen and he will begin to regard the digital world as a dialogic encounter between himself and those who developed the game. He will still have the same amount of faith, he will have the same expectations relating to the generation of the experience of the image, the seizing of his body, but the context and value of the experience will have changed for him.</div>

<div>When adults make a mistake or cannot understand something that is happening to their device, they approach the problem in a dialogic way. We try to figure out what the person who developed the software must have been thinking. It is a failure to communicate in the conveyance of a finite field of action and one might even write a letter to complain to the developers for not being user friendly enough. But this breakdown does nothing to lessen our faith and expectation in the production of an image. We act in a way that anticipates the device, when it is working properly, stimulating our bodies and allowing us to participate in events that have meaning for us. That is, we know there is a second-order finite world we can point our bodies towards. If this were not so, we would have nothing to complain about to the software developers.</div>

2.24</a> Videogames via the Image</h3>
	
<div>In the same way my CRT monitor above was able to highlight how one’s experience with a computer-generated image is the upspring of a more fundamental embodiment, videogames reveal how those same devices reappropriate the primordial faith that is fundamental to the experience of being and having a body. All software gives the user a second-order world where they can experience embodied intentionality in a strange and conflicting context, which reaffirms a Cartesian dualism that is fundamental to the modern sense of self. (In Sources of the Self, Taylor (<a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>) connects Cartesianism to modern selfhood, and in a previous essay I painted software as the supreme expression of the same). Videogames are instances of software that should be disturbing to us, because of their ambition to enact the fulfilment of a second-order world in such a literal way. For, there is no other way to describe their ambition. The sheer mass of recent open-world games is an obvious gesture to make my son’s naive presumptions a reality – to insert infinity into a finite plane through brute force computing power. This ambition is only made possible by ignoring the body, the only real infinite object at our disposal, which ironically is the foundation of the image itself as we have already shown. This is present throughout all software, but videogames are the forefront of bodily stimulation and capture because much of their appeal is in how they provide an alternate world for the body to perform. The body gets to pretend to ignore itself and the user experiences an empowering self-awareness and self-affirmation in this apparent conquering of their bodies. Videogames make the rasterized image of the mountain (explored in my beginning phenomenological treatment of the rasterized image) a field of possible action and the trend of videogames has been to increase the size of that field, to fulfil the bodies basic expectations towards infinity.</div>

<div>But even if effective infinity is achieved in the realm of possible action, as we see in games with continuous randomly generating worlds, finitude persists in other more basic elements of the experience which enable the self-affirming sever just described. While rasterization currently fulfils what I am describing here – it is true that the rasterized image does appear broken and we do immediately perceive it as such – it seems that ray tracing will eventually overcome this as graphics continue to approach photorealism. The famous Cornell Box experiment is an example of this, where researchers placed boxes in a controlled environment, took a picture, then simulated the same conditions with ray tracing to create two almost indistinguishable images. If it were possible to make a game with photographs, or a game that was indistinguishable from a video recording, this would do nothing to undermine what is fundamentally finite in the phenomenon. The only thing that has changed is the means by which the image is generated.  While this context can provide a great deal of meaning to the user, that significance is as much tied to the bodies ability to rupture whatever plane it is pointed towards into infinity, as it is to the limited nature of the image which gives it value and significance. The image still transpires within a device and the bodies relationship with the same will always be more basic. That we can tolerate our perception immediately being seized by the image is only possible because the rasterized or ray traced image is not a whole infinite phenomenon.</div> 

<div>The inexhaustibility we associate with our experiences in videogames or any other media, is the irreducibility of our own bodies and the bodies of other humans which constitute the event taking place. The spectacle is to feign detachment from our bodies and an infinite plane transpires in the dialectic between these two irreconcilable premises, namely between our bodies which are the conditions of there being anything at all and software as a contained event within an apparatus, concealed but nevertheless demonstrably finite. Computer graphics are not captivating because we are approaching the base of things in their accomplishment, they are captivating because they create the feeling of moving away from it. They are a false attempt to violate the body, and their value is dependent on that falsehood, on the failure of the enterprise, and the bodies ability to find the infinite wherever we point it.</div>

<div>I said earlier that the body, as an infinite object, is surrendered over to the apparatus as a finite object. We are now in a position to expand on what this entails and how it is only true according to a certain construal of infinity. The digital world is participated in and becomes real for us according to, to borrow Mimica’s phrase, a particular ‘intimation of infinity’. We could describe my son’s failure to appreciate the limitations of the digital world of Mega Man X2 as a failure to comprehend the type of infinity achieved in the apparatus. The numbers we experience in the various quantities associated with the experience of the images on the screen are connected to a particular understanding of infinity, which is a learned way of regarding our bodies. It is not a wholistic infinity but one that is continuous successive states which never find an end state. To use a computer and participate in the generated image on the screen is to learn to regard one’s body in this limited way. We know from the anthropological data Mimica presents that this is not the only way to intimate infinity, as we see in the Iqwaye, for example. So, it is not a question of following a course which resembles our base, embodied, experience, as we have already established via a phenomenological treatment. It is a learned orientation that we come to be able to approximate in relation to the device. This, in turn, entails a way of regarding our bodies as computational devices with a series of assemblages we call ‘sense organs’, which can be ‘tricked’ into seeing digital objects that are not really there. But we have seen above that this is not the case. Children see the digital image, and for them it is a real object, not because they have been fooled by the machine, children see a world of possible action they can orientate their bodies towards just like adults. Their naivety is rooted in an unfamiliarity with the particular kind of infinity we limit our bodies to.</div>

<div>Children do not appreciate the ray traced image on the grounds of realism, from films to hand drawn animation, all is equally real for it all holds the same potential to seize their bodies. I can demonstrate this with another conversation I had with my son, just last night when I was reading Winnie-the-Pooh to him.</div>   

<div>My son, Benjamin, who just turned four, asked, ‘Dad, where is Winnie-the-Pooh?’. I told him that I thought Winnie-the-Pooh was in a museum somewhere. (Here I am referring to the actual soft toy on which the stories were based). He then asked, ‘Does he walk around in the museum?’.<br>
‘No, he’s a teddy bear just like yours. And just like you make up stories with your toys, Christopher Robin’s dad made up stories about Winnie-the-Pooh and wrote them down in this book’.
‘But I’ve seen Winnie-the-Pooh moving and walking around on the TV’.<br> 
‘That was an animation’.<br>
‘What’s an animation?’<br>
‘An animation is when you get lots of pictures like this’, I then pointed to a picture of Winnie-the-Pooh in the book, ‘and put them together to make them move’.<br> 
After thinking about that for a while he asked,‘Is the Wiggles an animation?’<br>
‘No’, I replied, ‘the Wiggles are real people like you and me, but they make the pictures of them move in a similar way, using a camera’.</div>  

<div>For Benjamin, the Wiggles were just as ‘real’ as a Winnie-the-Pooh cartoon because he has not learned to celebrate degrees of resemblance and the pursuit of photo realism. Indeed, the question of reality was not a question for him until I taught him about a new style of reality which excludes Winnie-the-Pooh, but somehow, very strangely, includes the Wiggles even though the reality of their movement-image rests on the same grounds as Winnie-the-Pooh’s. This is to orientate him towards resemblance as a value and yardstick for technological achievement and bodily stimulation. And this is something computer generated images especially will gradually teach him to gear his body towards, because of the direction of its development. The way ray tracing looks better than rasterization must be interpreted, one must be taught why the former ‘looks better’. Images are coming to look more ‘real’ according to a certain standard. And this should not surprise us at all, especially in regard to computer graphics because a mathematics of association is what makes the devices and images possible in the first place, the trajectory of the devices development is directly tied to it and the reinforced expectations we continue to have around the stimulation of our bodies.</div>  

 <div>From here we can associate computer graphics with Russel’s definition of number as rooted in one-one correspondence. This is the theory of number that was assumed by Piaget in his treatment on the origins of number in children critiqued by Mimica. The above paragraph on children’s comprehension of the digital image lends itself to Mimica’s arguments because it shows that the kind of infinity assumed in the appreciation of the digital image to be learned and enculturated over time. One-one correspondence does not resemble the base of things, which computers have been able to harness and continue to approach through gradual improvements in the resemblance of the image to real life. We value ray tracing and photorealism through the premise of Russel’s theory of number, thought it is not solely Russel’s.</div>  

<div>This is also an assumption born from scientific convenience in that it is an infinity we can act and make progress on. There is always a further enhancement of the image to instigate and computing is based on the premise that everything is countable, including infinity in the fulness of time, and everything is either true or false. There is always another false, a failure pertaining to the question for photorealism. There is always another inaccuracy to make true, and the Cornell box demonstrates nothing because it is a closed and controlled environment, and the likeness is in regards to the photo while the experience of the room is a non-issue, for it harbours a different kind of infinity that cannot be approached in any way.</div>

<div>The room that is not a photo but the experience of one’s body as an infinite object is never approach in the Cornell Box experiment or in any instance of ray tracing or rasterization.  The body, as the precondition for there being anything at all is holistically infinite in how it extends an inexhaustible field. It is not something that never runs out, like the consecutive ones and zeros of a computer, but infinite in the sense that the field is everything that there is. There is nothing to add to it, no false inaccuracies to later be made true. Removing a sensory organ subtracts nothing from it because it is existence itself, our being in the world. It is the field in which we orientate ourselves towards an object.</div> 

<div>We orientate ourselves around our devices to adopt a stance that will allow us to come to terms with them, discovering their meaning for us as participants in a world shared with other humans. The image engages our bodies by stimulating the habitual paths of our sensory organs and offering a limited field of potential action. We give our bodies to the phenomenon, exercise a belief and expectation in regard to a second-order world, and thereby imbue the image with infinity. Not the limited infinity found in the device itself, but that which is inexhaustible in us as bodies inhabiting a space that encompasses everything in existence. This is how our experience with a computer-generated image can be described as beholding our bodies, though we do not always realise that is what we are doing. I am not looking at a rasterized mountain, I am looking at myself, or my body, as it is stimulated, and this is the orientation with the device that harbours the most meaning and potential action for me. So, my gaze is diverted away from the thing itself and towards the faculties within that can find an inexhaustible field wherever they are pointed and marvelling at the fact. For things on the computer to be infinite in the sense that is basic to lived experience, to achieve the miracle I referred to earlier, the image must refer back to our bodies, the body must be reintroduced, unbeknownst to ourselves, for a second time and we must be reminded of something that refers to our being in the world more broadly. The image transcends the parameters of the machine, it can do this, notwithstanding the limitations of the apparatus and the means by which the image has come into existence by referring to something infinite and that is, by appealing to the body in a more fundamental way. This cycle, just described ought to baffle us, for it demonstrates the habit our bodies have of finding infinity wherever they are pointed, even when they are pointed at a machine designed to capture them and a philosophical stance that does not seem to believe in it.</div>  

<div>I will now close with a very brief example of what I have just described. It has to be an example of a digital image that does not depend on narrative context to be recognisable, for narrative is not where we are trying to locate infinity. It also needs to exemplify outdated graphics so as to avoid the tendency to base its value on some kind of resemblance to reality or quantities of detail. But we should also be careful to avoid a aesthetic analyses or appreciation of the image, for that is not immediately given. On these grounds, this final example could be almost any outdated rasterized image. But considering the contributions my son has made to this essay and the ideas presented in it, it seems only proper to end with the character design from Mega Man X. For, even with this simple organisation of pixels, deprived of the value current ideologies of graphical realism might place on it, we are able to recognise our bodies immediately grasp for and construct an inexhaustible field around it. This is all possible through the way the image is able to inspire in us a reference back to our bodies and embodied experience, or to the conditions that have given us the image in the first place.</div>

3 VIOLENCE: THE VIDEOGAME EVENT</h2>
	
	<h3 id="3.1"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.1</a> Three Existentialists</h3>

<div>Rosenzweig’s (<a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>) magnum opus, <em>The Star of Redemption</em>, opens with a critique of Western philosophy’s efforts to transcend death. He argues that philosophical systems like Hegel’s (<a href="#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>) fail to account for an individual’s fear of mortality, such singularities are abandoned in the ultimate cognition of the All; ‘Why should philosophy be concerned if the fear of death knows nothing of such a dichotomy between body and soul, if it roars Me! Me! Me! … for all this dire necessity philosophy has only its vacuous smile’ (Rosenzweig <a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:3). Rosenzweig’s subsequent existentialism offers redemption from death by incorporating it into the system he builds throughout the book; the text opens with ‘from death’ and ends with the words ‘into life’. Rather than a conclusion, Rosenzweig later points to ‘into life’ as an invitation to verify the central motifs of the work, namely love, language and the name, ‘in the course of everyday life’ (Rosenzweig cited in Glatzer <a href="#Glatzer 1985" target="_blank" title="Glatzer NN (1985), ‘Forward’">1985</a>:xviii). The baggage and subjectivity of the individual become foundational and a source of insight instead of something to be overcome.</div>
		
<div>This is how Rosenzweig (<a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>) associates philosophy’s attitude towards death with its quest to avoid all presuppositions. For, to acknowledge the terror one experiences before the imperceptible void of death is hardly a neutral vantage point from which to explore philosophical questions. Yet for many — especially Rosenzweig, serving in an anti-aircraft unit during the First World War, writing these words on a small military postcard (Pollock <a href="#Pollock 2019" target="_blank" title="Pollock B (29 January 2019), ‘Franz Rosenzweig’">2019</a>:para.2) — daily life is framed ‘over the grave which yawns at our feet with every step’ (Rosenzweig <a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:3). The philosopher has no right to assume a more elevated position.</div>
		
<div>Rosenzweig (<a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>) is not alone in the way he grounds his philosophy through the frame of mortality, especially among other philosophers often associated with his strand of existentialism. Death is an essential theme in the writings of Marcel (<a href="#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:72) who noted that, ‘Certain readers will be surprised at the role played by death, suicide, betrayal, in all of my writings’. For him, these themes were indispensable;</div>
<blockquote class="small">I do not think we can ever ascribe enough importance to these, and any philosophy which tries to elude them or conjure them away, is guilty of the worst possible kind of betrayal. (Marcel <a href="#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:72)</blockquote>
<div>The ‘betrayal’ Marcel is referring to aligns his reasons for focusing on death with Rosenzweig’s. Both authors associate the acknowledgement of the lived experience of death with an acceptance of presuppositions. Throughout <em>Creative Fidelity</em>, Marcel (<a href="#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:4) resists any ‘claims to install himself at the centre of being’. This commitment to lived experience was demonstrated in the way Marcel presented his ideas and explored concepts in his plays and metaphysical journals (see Marcel <a href="#Marcel 1949" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1949) Being and having">1949</a>; <a href="#Marcel 2007" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (2007) A path to peace: fresh hope for the world: dramatic explorations">2007</a>). His thought commences from lived experience and, after exploring concepts within, points the reader back towards the same. Marcel shares this final invitation with Rosenzweig, though he differs in his determination to remain within lived experience itself, hence his sometimes preferred format of a daily journal, reflecting on his own death and the role it is playing on the development of his thought (Marcel <a href="#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:12).</div>
		
<div>Buber (<a href="#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2002</a>:16) shares an anecdote in <em>Between Man and Man</em> which demonstrates how everyday life and the impact of death contributed to his own thought:</div>
<blockquote class="small">What happened was no more than that one forenoon, after a morning of ‘religious’ enthusiasm, I had a visit from an unknown young man, without being there in spirit. I certainly did not fail to let the meeting be friendly, I did not treat him any more remissly than all his contemporaries who were in the habit of seeking me out about this time of day as an oracle that is ready to listen to reason. I conversed attentively and openly with him—only I omitted to guess the questions which he did not put. Later, not long after, I learned from one of his friends—he himself was no longer alive—the essential content of these questions; I learned that he had come to me not casually, but borne by destiny, not for a chat but for a decision. He had come to me, he had come in this hour. What do we expect when we are in despair and yet go to a man? Surely a presence by means of which we are told that nevertheless there is meaning.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="small">Since then I have given up the ‘religious’ which is nothing but the exception, extraction, exaltation, ecstasy; or it has given me up.</blockquote>
<div>We can assume that this experience was foundational for Buber in the development of his thought. I anticipate that some will regard it to be so, solely on the grounds of it being an instance of his conversion out of the religious enthusiasm that he previously embraced. But I share it here to highlight how Buber’s subsequent philosophical anthropology is grounded in everyday interpersonal acts of dialogue. The young man’s death, in the story, awoke Buber to the illegitimacy of a division separating, not only the temporal and spiritual life, but a distinct vantage point in philosophy from which the whole can be circumscribed. Buber’s philosophical anthropology is similar to Rosenzweig (<a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>) and Marcel’s (<a href="#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>) thought because it embraces the subjective human perspective, which includes a fear of death. Indeed, it was through the regret Buber felt in the above story, when the reality of death entered his life, that he was brought down to the everyday.</div>

3.2</a> Christchurch</h3>

<div>This reality can abruptly enter our lives at any time, as it did for me in a relatively small way compared to those closer to it, upon learning of the terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, 15 March 2019. The news reports showed footage from the attacker’s live stream, moments before he killed 51 people (ABC News <a href="#ABC News 2019" target="_blank" title="ABC News (3 May 2019) ‘Christchurch mosque attack death toll rises to 51 after man dies in hospital’">2019</a>). From a first-person perspective we saw the man drive and get out of his car, then approach the mosque with his gun visible. The perspective of the footage is significant, for it seems to demonstrate a truth which is easy to ignore about the horrors humans are capable of and one’s own potential as a human, that we share something with the terrorist as much as we would like to remove ourselves from him. Put another way, the first-person perspective invites you to imagine that you are the attacker.</div>

<div>The obvious reaction to this phenomenon is to distance ourselves from the man as much as possible: he is insane, a monster who I share nothing with. On the day of the shootings, New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern (<a href="#Ardern 2019" target="_blank" title="Ardern J (15 March 2019), ‘Christchurch shootings mark “unprecedented act of violence”, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says’">2019</a>:para.6-8), expressed such a distance which also reinforced national identity and values,</div>
<blockquote class="small">Many of those who will have been directly affected by this shooting may be migrants to New Zealand, they may even be refugees here. They have chosen to make New Zealand their home and it is their home. They are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not. They have no place in New Zealand.</blockquote>
<div>But this recourse to national identity is not available to Australians who share their nationality with the terrorist. We must become separated from the evil being presented in a different way, by emphasising how incorrect the man’s beliefs about the world are and how far removed they are from our own. This is often extended to the point where one dehumanises the attacker, othering them as much as possible — ‘it was an inhuman act’, ‘he is a monster’.</div>
		
<div>However, I will argue that this approach is ultimately unsatisfactory and that there is no lasting redemption in our impulse to other human turpitude. I do not mean redemption for the man who killed those people, but for myself and for humanity generally, as ones who share and participate in a world where such atrocities are not only possible but frequent. As we work to push the intentions, ideas and the humanness of evildoers as far from our own identity as possible, the more repulsed we becomes with humanity generally, our entire situation and thus with oneself. While this kind of thinking is often motivated by deeply moral convictions, it ultimately leads to a philosophy like Ivan Karamazov’s. Not a disbelief in God or in a higher purpose necessarily, but a rejection of the world and an attempt to disavowal our participation in it. For Ivan, the suffering of a single child cannot be worth any end, no matter how glorious, so he wants to give back his ‘ticket’ (Dostoevsky <a href="#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>:245). As he puts it to his brother, ‘would you agree to be the architect of such conditions?’ — the Christchurch shooting and innumerable other atrocities notwithstanding. But as Taylor (<a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:451) has explained, Ivan’s returning of the ticket,</div>
<blockquote class="small">is to close oneself off in a vicious circle. Rejecting the world seals one’s sense of its loathsomeness and of one’s own, insofar as one is a part of it.</blockquote>
<div>The kind of redemption I have in mind here would entail escaping this ‘vicious cycle’ completely.</div>
		
<div> In Ursula K. Le Guin’s (<a href="#Le Guin 1973" target="_blank" title="Le Guin UK (1973) The wind’s twelve quarters">1973</a>:251-259) famous short story, ‘The Ones Who Walked Away from Omelas’, a utopia is described that is conditional on the suffering of a single child. I heard someone refer to this story at an anthropology seminar about asylum seekers on Manus Island. It occurred to me then that what people were interpreting to be the final moral of the story, to be ‘one who walks away from Omelas’, entails many of the same moral motivations as Ivan’s rejection of the world, as well as the same fundamental flaw. Many seemed deeply moved by the short description of the story notwithstanding, and I have to acknowledge the moral courage behind gestures like that in Le Guin’s story or Dostoevsky’s (<a href="#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>) character Ivan. These rejections of the world are founded on the noblest of intentions. They are commendable and perhaps appropriate in certain contexts. However, they cannot be foundational to how we rationalise our position and participation in the world.</div>

<div>For, when such is applied so broadly, it slowly transforms from being self-righteousness to self-loathing and ultimately, as our three existentialists and Dostoevsky (<a href="#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>) have each argued in their own ways, suicidal. That is how Rosenzweig (<a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:3-4) describes any philosophy that ‘takes upon itself to throw off the fear of all things earthly… [one that] can truly recommend only suicide, not the fated death for all’. Had Rosenzweig lived to witness the Second World War, it seems he would be been sympathetic to Marcel’s (<a href="#Marcel 1950" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1950) The mystery of being: reflection and mystery">1950</a>:23) description of it:</div>
<blockquote class="small">We live today in a world at war with itself, and this state of world-war is being pushed so far that it runs the risk of ending in something that could properly be described as world-suicide.</blockquote>
<div>If pre-world war philosophies like Hegel’s (<a href="#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>) are symptomatic of a condition which leads to mass death, the tragedy in Christchurch and others like it suggests we have not entirely grown out of those conditions. We are still clinging to the prospect of a transcendental enthusiasm like Buber’s (<a href="#Buber 1947" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1947/2004) Between man and man">1947/2002</a>), to lift us out of the everyday anxieties of mortality towards something timeless and all encompassing. Though we express our flee from the world in a way that is philosophically and practically very different to Buber’s religious enthusiasm, we can still draw attention to the gesture. Philosophically in the domain of posthumanism, as it rejects the confines and terrifying implications of subjectivity, and practically in how we succumb to the immersive images being enabled by new and emerging technologies. Neither of these retreats from everyday-human-anxieties will come to terms with our participation in a world we find to be deeply flawed. Dostoevsky's (<a href="#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>) characters who cannot meet this challenge ultimately destroy themselves and the lives of those they come into contact with. And this describes the condition we are behoved to seek a redemption from.</div>

	<h3 id="3.3"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.3</a> Redemption (a)</h3>

<div>It is possible to construe the distancing and rejection of the world just described as a kind of redemption in itself — I am being broad here and will only describe it as a general direction. This direction might entail, like Ivan Karamazov, returning one’s ticket (like relinquishing our biases towards anthropocentrism), or it could mean something profoundly spiritual and escapist. Regardless, rather than leaning into lived experience these stances seek to get beyond it somehow, be it morally, spiritually or philosophically. It is a cathartic diversion to insist the injustices of the world will never add up, that they do not need to or that God will somehow make them all add up in the end.</div>
		
<div>While a more standard way to separate reactions to death and suffering is to consider those who believe in a higher purpose and those who do not, here I am getting at an entirely different distinction. There are atheists, theists and polytheists who lean into the experience of death and those who lean out of it. The atheist leaning out elevates their moral dispositions to condemn creation, while the theist might reject the world on the basis of original sin. I say all this because it is important to separate what I am doing from notions of religious belief or the spiritual. It is not a matter of belief but of coping. I say they are ‘leanings’ because it seems unlikely for anyone to complete a trajectory in or out of lived experience, thus they are mere directions.</div>

<div>Dostoevsky (<a href="#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>), the existentialist that he was, and unlike his character, Ivan, always leaned into the experience of suffering and death in his fiction. Much of this was, no doubt, inspired by a number of dramatic life experiences where leaning out, finding solace beyond this life, seemed unavailable. In 1849, Dostoevsky was sentenced to death for belonging to a secret utopian society before his sentence was changed at the last minute. In a letter to his brother he wrote:</div>
<blockquote class="small">Then three of us were set against the posts so as to carry out the execution. We were summoned in threes; consequently I was in the second group, and there was not more than a minute left to live. I remembered you, my brother, and all yours; at the last minute you, you alone, were in my mind, and it was only then that I realized how much I love you, my dearest brother! I also succeeded in embracing Pleshcheyeve and Durov, who were beside me, and bade farewell to them. Finally the retreat was sounded, those who had been tied up to the posts were led back, and they read to us that His Imperial Majesty granted us our lives. Thereupon followed the actual sentence…</blockquote>
<blockquote class="small">Brother, I am not depressed and haven’t lost spirit. Life everywhere is life, life is in ourselves and not in the external. There will be people near me, and to be a human being among human beings, and remain one forever, no matter what misfortunes befall, not to become depressed and not to falter — this is what life is, herein lies the task. (Dostoevsky cited in Pevear <a href="#Pevear 2004" target="_blank" title="Pevear R (2004), ‘Introduction’">2004</a>:xii)</blockquote>
<div>During and after this close encounter with death, Dostoevsky found redemption in the present experience of being ‘a human being among other human beings’ (Dostoevsky cited by Pevear <a href="#Pevear 2004" target="_blank" title="Pevear R (2004), ‘Introduction’">2004</a>:xii), reflecting on the love he had for his brother and embracing his friends.</div>
		
<div>It was perhaps the above experience that set Dostoevsky (<a href="#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>) on a trajectory to explore the themes of redemption in <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>. There is no better way to present Dostoevsky’s argument than the narrative provided in the book, but Taylor (<a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>) effectively summarises its argument this way:</div>
<blockquote class="small">What will transform us is an ability to love the world and ourselves, to see it as good in spite of the wrong. But this will only come to us if we accept being part of it, and that means accepting responsibility. Just as ‘no one is to blame’ is the slogan of the materialist revolutionaries, so ‘we are all to blame’ is of Dostoevsky’s healing figures. Loving the world and ourselves is in a sense a miracle, in face of all the evil and degradation that it and we contain. But the miracle comes on us if we accept being part of it. Involved in this is our acceptance of love from others. We become capable of love through being loved…</blockquote>
<div>This accepting responsibility for the evils of the world entails a shouldering of universal guilt. The character Dimitri maintains that he did not murder his father, but by the end of the book acknowledges that he wanted to and thus participated in the same evil responsible for his father’s death. In the story, we see how this acceptance of guilt can open someone up to accept love from others which in turn leads to a love and gratitude for the world or what Rosenzweig (<a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>) would describe as a continual process of creation.</div>
		
<div>I have never killed anyone, but I have been angry before; I have never shot anyone, but I have shot a gun before; I have never shot people before, but I have seen a point of view similar to the one in Christchurch with a gun floating at the bottom of the screen while playing a videogame and I did shoot people. This is a radical leaning into the evil of the world, acknowledging oneself as a participant in the perpetuation of suffering and death.</div>
		
<div>The description of Dostoevsky’s (<a href="#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>) redemption that I have provided here is incomplete because it is inescapably tied, as I have already mentioned, to the narrative of The Brothers Karamazov. Fiction and other kinds of art can offer a unique kind of redemption that is able to point back to experience itself. They offer a silent explanation that is unique to the person, which can often be especially clear by virtue of the fact that it does not try to get behind anything like a metaphysical system and neither does it abandon life’s most precious components to a sea of entropy. Art does not try to get under experience, it lifts it up in a way that is redeeming. It points to creation, not the traditional seven-day biblical creation, but the Rosenzweigian notion of creation as a continual process. The universe is ever renewed, it keeps saying ‘yes’, that is the primordial yes of existence, and within that yes is a no and the no says, ‘not otherwise’ (Rosenzweig <a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:27-28). Notwithstanding one’s own limitations and shortcomings and one’s broken participation in that yes, the ever-enduring base of things continues its resounding ‘not otherwise’ and hidden therein is the ‘yes’ of creation (Rosenzweig <a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>). Art has a way of directing us back towards our participation in creation, the acceptance of which allows us to find beauty and redemption within our everyday lives.</div>

3.4</a> Death Mechanics</h3>
		
<div>After viewing the footage from the aforementioned terrorist attack in Christchurch, the first-person perspective, with the gun visible at the bottom of the frame, immediately reminded me of many first-person shooter videogames I had played. Of course, in most games within the genre, the player’s role is not to shoot innocent people, but the aggression and violence are still present enough to make the footage from Christchurch reminiscent of the gesture. This is not a new association and was most notably draw from the Columbine shooting in 1999, even without the first-person footage to evoke the comparison (for example, Consalvo <a href="#Consalvo 2003" target="_blank" title="Consalvo M (2003) ‘The monsters next door: media constructions of boys and masculinity’">2003</a>:38-39). And there are more recent examples, like Trump’s comments after two mass shootings that killed thirty-one people last year: ‘We must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace’ (Trump cited in Draper <a href="#Draper 2019" target="_blank" title="Draper K (5 August 2019) ‘Video Games Aren’t Why Shootings Happen. Politicians Still Blame Them.’">2019</a>).</div>
		
<div>The themes I have explored above became associated with videogames in my mind after viewing the footage from the aforementioned terrorist attack in Christchurch. The first-person perspective, with the gun visible at the bottom of the frame, immediately reminded me first-person shooter videogames I had played. Of course, in most games within the genre, the player’s role is not to shoot innocent people, but the aggression and violence are still present. I am not here to present an argument regarding violence in videogames, this is just how I came to associate the medium with the human need for redemption and what it has to offer in relation to that need. I stumbled out of the vicious cycle Taylor (<a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>) described above — the loathing for the world and oneself that often develops as we try to cope with evil — as a result of the connection I made between how the moments before the attack were presented in the media and my own participation in a similar kind of depiction of violence found in first-person shooters. This kind of shift into everyday life and one’s participation in an imperfect and evil world is not dependent that connection, but it does highlight the kind of redemption generally on offer in the medium of videogames and how similar it is to Rosenzweig’s (<a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>) picture of philosophy or Ivan Karamazov’s returning of the ticket.</div>
		
<div>Most videogames treat player mortality in a very similar way. In order to progress, a section must be cleared without dying. If the character you control does die, the section is repeated. There is a great deal of variation within this trope, for example, some fast-paced platformers like <em>Super Meat Boy</em> (McMillen and Refenes <a href="#McMillen 2010" target="_blank" title="McMillen E and Refenes T (designers) (2010) Super meat boy [videogame]">2010</a>) or <em>Celeste</em> (Thorson <a href="#Thorson 2018" target="_blank" title="Thorson M (director) (2018) Celeste [videogame]">2018</a>) have quick re-spawn times and plenty of checkpoints while roguelikes like <em>Spelunky 2</em> (Yu <a href="#Yu 2020" target="_blank" title="Yu D (director) (2020) Spelunky 2 [videogame]">2020</a>) have what is called ‘permadeath’ where the player has to start the whole game again. Regardless of how this kind of death mechanic is integrated into a particular game, the general notion is the same — if you die, you get to try again. We could attribute this mechanic to the historical development and genesis of the medium, or describe replayability as an essential component that gives games in the broader sense value. We could bring the existence of death as the taken for granted loose-state in videogames into question, picking up Chris Crawford’s (<a href="#Crawford 1992" target="_blank" title="Crawford C (1992) 'GDC founder chris crawford's dragon speech'">1992</a>) famous critique of the medium’s obsession with spacial representation and the limitations that focus places on games themselves, violence and death in videogames then being the path of least resistance. Whatever the reason for this almost universal approach to player mortality, in light of what has been discussed in the previous sections, we can attribute the appeal of this game mechanic to a kind of redemption. When one plays a videogame, another identity within another world is often pretended and represented in some way, death is also represented, and though such is often done so in a way that is narratively complex, like in <em>Neir: Autamata</em> (Taro <a href="#Taro 2017" target="_blank" title="Taro Y (director) (2017) Nier: Automata [videogame]">2017</a>) or <em>The Last of Us</em> (Straley and Druckmann <a href="#Straley 2013" target="_blank" title="Straley B and Druckmann N (directors) (2013) The last of us [videogame]">2013</a>), there is little variation regarding that which makes videogames unique as a medium, namely game mechanics, or around that character in the story who the player will inevitably sympathise with, the character they control. Thus, even in games that supposedly have something to say about death and player mortality like <em>Dark Souls</em> (Miyazaki <a href="#Miyazaki 2011" target="_blank" title="Miyazaki H (director) (2011) Dark souls [videogame]">2011</a>), the redemption it presents is the same — you get to try again until you win and feel good about yourself. The posture assumed here is leaning away from the lived reality of suffering and death in the world. Death in a videogame can be disappointing, but the experience of it is far removed from the trauma of real death. Death is repeatedly depicted in videogames, you could play Mega Man for five minutes and die five times in a row, but it is rarely confronted for what it is.</div>
	
	<h3 id="3.5"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.5</a> Realism and Death</h3>
		
<div>This stance becomes more apparent as the industry continues to strive for higher levels of realism. The game is perceived as less abstract and resembles real life more closely but the death mechanic remains the same, the depiction of death, then, becomes more defiant and preposterous. Its function as a kind of redemption increases too in this regard because it has come closer to replicating the reality we need redemption from. This makes sense in the common description of videogames as a kind of escapism, but videogames can also serve here as a case study for Heidegger's (<a href="#Heidegger 1954" target="_blank" title="Heidegger M (1954/2013) The question concerning technology and other essays">1954/2013</a>) description of technology when it is understood to be metaphysics completing itself. Videogames, particularly in the pursuit of realism like in the case of virtual reality or ray tracing, are an expression of a philosophical stance toward the world, that is the kind of philosophical stance Rosenzweig (<a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>) was so critical of. With every new iteration of virtual reality or graphical realism, an underlying ontological stance is being demonstrated, a trajectory is being put on display, that says we are capturing reality by replicating it, and we are coming closer to the much anticipated perfect simulation. In such a simulation we will replicate every aspect of human experience, the motivation is there to do so, with one major exception, namely death.</div>
	
	<h3 id="3.6"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.6</a> Killing Mechanics</h3>
		
<div>This is not only in respect to player mortality, but the act of killing in videogames too. I will never forget the first time I killed someone playing <em>Skyrim VR</em> (Howard <a href="#Howard 2017" target="_blank" title="Howard T (director) (2017) Elder scrolls v: Skyrim VR [videogame]">2017</a>): immersed in a virtual world, an NPC came at me with a sword, I swung my arm, I saw a sword move through the virtual space and I repeated the gesture until their body went limp and the fell to the ground. It seems that a number of factors made the experience more affecting than if I had done the same action on my computer and not in VR. Firstly, it felt like the NPC was about the same height as me and after striking them down I had to lower my head to look down at their body. Also, the action of swinging my arm felt very aggressive, identical to the motion of hitting someone in real life.</div>

Each time we push the square button Ellie swings her pipe. As distressing as this scene is to play through, our own internal conflict lends itself to the conflict Ellie is experiencing in the narrative. As the game’s creative director and lead co-writer, Druckmann (<a href="#Druckmann June 2020" target="_blank" title="Druckmann N (25 June 2020) Last of us 2 spoilercast w/ Niel Druckman, Ashley Johnson, Troy Baker - gamescast ep. 26 [video]">2020</a>:<a href="https://youtu.be/g6rRfK-V2jY?t=5049" target="_blank" title="watch">1°24’09”</a>), explained, when players are…</div>

<div>The game does not give players an option here, we can either keep pushing the square button or stop playing the game. The only way to progress in the story, is to participate in this image of violence, bring it about, and so it is like a rite of passage. But players are never fully in the act because of the presupposition that what is on the screen is only an image and the knowledge that we have only assumed a role. This is the misalignment Druckmann was talking about; we disassociate ourselves from the morality of the characters we control which is at odds with the act of playing the game. This tension also describes the problem of the violent image more generally, a phenomenon we, as participants, play an essential role in but which we will not hesitate to condemn on the grounds of its content. <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> shows how videogames can direct our attention beyond the confines of an image and towards the act of violence itself by making the performance that is imaging violence explicit.</div>

<div>Computer generated images of violence are not equivalent to real violence and while this seems obvious, it is an important aspect of media to acknowledge. This can often be forgotten with the ease with which we speak of certain images as 'violent'. The image depicts violence, but it is not what violence is – at least not in the respect to which these descriptions are referring.</div>

(<a href="#Carnage 2007" target="_blank" title="Carnage NL, Anderson CA and Bushman BJ (2007) ‘The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to real-life violence’">2007</a>) mistake in the article titled, ‘The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to real-life violence’, was to assume that a video recording of violence equates to the actual phenomenon. As Alex Golub (<a href="#Golub 2006" target="_blank" title="Golub A (28 July 2006) ‘Economists and anthropologists on video game violence’">2006</a>:para.4) noted, ‘there was no “real-life violence” in the study’, participants were only shown a ‘10-min videotape of real violence’ (Carnagey et al. <a href="#Carnage 2007" target="_blank" title="Carnage NL, Anderson CA and Bushman BJ (2007) ‘The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to real-life violence’">2007</a>:492) after playing a violent videogame, and their response levels were measured. Rather than revealing the desensitizing effects of videogame violence this study reveals the researchers’ conflation of violent images and real-world violence. The researches’ anxiety regarding the image is built on the presupposition that the image conveys phenomena in a way that is equivalent to a lived experience of violence. Their error is rooted in a confused problematic, also identified by Welsh (<a href="#Welsh 2016" target="_blank" title="Welsh TJ (2016) Mixed realism: videogames and the violence of fiction">2016</a>) in the first level of his book, Mixed Realism, which places the real and virtual in conflict, but leaves open the possibility the two being mistaken for each other.</div>

<div>Even more careful studies of videogame violence often participate in this conflation which is convenient to the criticism of the genre. This includes commentaries on videogame violence found in videogames themselves like in <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> (Davis and Coulon <a href="#Davis 2012" target="_blank" title="Davis C and Coulon F (directors) (2012) Spec op: the line [videogame]">2012</a>). The game is a commentary of military shooters which draws attention to the player’s willingness to commit violent acts, but this is often accomplished by imbuing players actions with a false moral weight. </div>
		
<div>That is, by equating the production of violent images with real violence. A loading screen from the game, quoted by Keogh (<a href="#Keogh 2012" target="_blank" title="Keogh B (2012) Killing is harmless: a critical reading of Spec Ops: the Line">2012</a>:8) reads: ‘To kill for yourself is murder. To kill for your government is heroic. To kill for entertainment is harmless’ (Davis and Coulon <a href="#Davis 2012" target="_blank" title="Davis C and Coulon F (directors) (2012) Spec op: the line [videogame]">2012</a>). And Koegh is fulling willing to go along with the metaphysical and ethically reductive implications of this description of killing; ‘Of course we aren’t “actually” killing when we kill in a videogame. But after playing The Line, I‘m no longer sure the answer is that simple’ (Keogh <a href="#Keogh 2012" target="_blank" title="Keogh B (2012) Killing is harmless: a critical reading of Spec Ops: the Line">2012</a>:8). But it should become that simple the moment we compare the act of killing in a videogame to the act of killing in real life – something Sontag’s (<a href="#Sontag 2004" target="_blank" title="Sontag S (23 May 2004) ‘Regarding The Torture Of Others’">2004</a>:para.8) well-meaning declaration fails to leave space for: ‘the horror of what is shown in the photographs cannot be separated from the horror that the photographs were taken’. This is not to dismiss the event of violent images in videogames or any other context, only to say that we are dealing with something entirely different to the lived experience of violence, and that an effort must be made to maintain the distinction.</div>

<div>Of course, the image is real. Let us get to talking about what the image is and what is violent about it. Anyone who has experienced real violence or trauma in their life knows that dramatizations, rasterized animations or even actual recordings or photos do nothing to convey the lived experience of such events. To forget this is to reduce reality to the confines of a screen. Videogames and other visual media can point to real violence via what is irreducible in the artform, but what we see in the finite image, if anything, is something to be overcome in that regard.</div>

	<h3 id="3.9"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.9</a> 'That which Cannot be Expressed' (a)</h3>
		
<div>We see this is being overcome in Erkan Özgen’s (<a href="#Özgen 2019" target="_blank" title="Özgen E (2019) Giving voices">2019</a>) work. For example, in his four-minute piece titled Wonderland (Özgen <a href="#Özgen 2016" target="_blank" title="Özgen E (2016) Wonderland [single-channel digital video]">2016</a>), thirteen-year-old Mohammed, who is both mute and deaf, tells the story of his flee from ISIS. Özgen (<a href="#Özgen 2019" target="_blank" title="Özgen E (2019) Giving voices">2019</a>:48) observes how, ‘The power of his body language made any other language form insufficient and insignificant’. Muhammed’s story reveals ‘the savagery that has been engraved in his body and memory’ (Özgen <a href="#Özgen 2019" target="_blank" title="Özgen E (2019) Giving voices">2019</a>:48), not via excessive and explicit detail, but through his unique ability to convey something that cannot be stated in words or even represented in an isolated image. His performance transcends the confines of the image. For, when violence is in question it has to; ‘The trauma of war and violence lays within both what is said and that which cannot be expressed’ (Özgen <a href="#Özgen 2019" target="_blank" title="Özgen E (2019) Giving voices">2019</a>:17).</div>
		
<div>In the torture scene described above, we never see the direct effects of our pushing the square button on Nora, though we hear her painful cries. The camera never leaves Ellies face. By not detailing the event with pixels on the screen, this lends an infinity to our actions in the game, an excess which enables the notion of an irreducible violence that can never be truly represented.</div>
		
<div>But something blasphemous is revealed in the computer-generated image of violence when it is placed next to an account that transcends any language or medium, provided by a witness like Muhammed. For, notwithstanding what the developers at Naughty Dog (Druckmann et al. <a href="#Druckmann 2020" target="_blank" title="Druckmann N, Newman A and Margenau K (directors) (2020) The last of us part ii [videogame]">2020</a>) are careful to withhold, this does nothing to prevent the torture scene from being a fabricated image of violence as opposed to the reality of Muhammed’s embodied performance of trauma which is not a reduction at all.  But inasmuch as both technologies participate in the reductive act of image making – they are both forms of capture – both have the creative potential to transcend the same on some level.</div>
	
	<h3 id="3.10"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.10</a> What is Affecting</h3>
		
<div>We are considering a videogame, which is both a motion-captured performance and an artistic rendering, as opposed to the human suffering more directly captured through a camera. We experience an image of someone being killed in a film with special effects very differently to footage of someone who was actually killed in real life, not because of any qualitative difference in the image necessarily, but because of what we contribute to the experience of the image. This is made apparent in Spike Lee’s (<a href="#Lee 2020" target="_blank" title="Lee S (director) (2020) Da 5 bloods [motion picture]">2020</a>) recent film, Da 5 Bloods, in which fictional depictions of violence accomplished with special effects are interspersed with archive footage from the Vietnam War. The latter is more affecting because we know it is a recording of a historical event, even while the fabricated violent images appear more gruesome, detailed and, in a sense, more ‘real’. We bring the differentiating context from sources other than the image itself and this context contributes towards our experience and interpretation of the image. Real people have experienced suffering that corresponds to what is being conveyed on The Last of Us Part II (Druckmann et al. <a href="#Druckmann 2020" target="_blank" title="Druckmann N, Newman A and Margenau K (directors) (2020) The last of us part ii [videogame]">2020</a>), at least in terms of its severity, if not in detail – of that we can be sure. Thus, the game represents a scope of victims which is as broad as its failure to truly convey their suffering is.</div>
	
	<h3 id="3.11"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.11</a> 'That which Cannot be Expressed' (b)</h3>
		
<div>Whether an image has been developed though motion capture and 3D rendering or some actual instance of violence has been captured through a camera, both phenomena move us to regard them in the same way. In Baudrillard’s (<a href="#Baudrillard 1995" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1995) The Gulf War did not take place">1995</a>:30-31) <em>The Gulf War Did Not Take Place</em>, he describes ‘the impossibility of illustrating this indeterminacy of war’ when the images describing it are positioned to compete with advertisements for viewer’s attention; ‘the world and the violence of the world [has been turned] into a consumable substance’. The consumption of an image constitutes an essential part in its production, the role of the viewer.</div>
		
<div>And this realisation can help us to point more precisely at the actual violence occurring in the event of the image, which is the reduction of violence into an image itself. Viewers participate in violence via their participation in the generation of the image and in the reduction of that event. One redeeming factor for the torture scene described above, as an artistic exploration of violence, might be found in the decision to point the camera at Ellie’s face rather than at Nora’s mangled body, which we are left only to imagine. By doing so, the game at least directs our attention towards the role we have assumed and the real violence transpiring in the act of that assumption. The participation necessary for the violent image to exist is made a part of the image itself in the form of a button prompt.</div>
		
<div>Consumers play a role in the production of any violent image, but <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> (Druckmann et al. <a href="#Druckmann 2020" target="_blank" title="Druckmann N, Newman A and Margenau K (directors) (2020) The last of us part ii [videogame]">2020</a>) shows how videogames are in a unique position to draw attention to the actual violence taking place in that event. And we could even say videogames have the potential to show us how every image portraying the human bears some resemblance to this gesture of capture and, in this way, is violent. For, it is ‘a different nature that speaks to the camera than that which speaks to the eye’; Benjamin (<a href="#Benjamin 1931" target="_blank" title="Benjamin W (1931/2015) ‘Small history of photography’">1931/2015</a>:67) saw how the camera revealed peculiarities about reality previously never thought of. But videogames are not a capturing apparatus. They do not reveal to us, with a new gaze, some unexplored style for apprehending an object in the world. Rather, videogames are revealing an unexplored style of apprehending and participating in images themselves. <em>Part II</em>, more than most videogames, makes the decision to participate in the generation of violent images immediately explicit. The player gets to consciously choose to bring about a flawed portrayal of violence, which will never encompass the actual phenomenon. A space is then made for this act to be responded to and problematized, which is exactly what this profoundly violent videogame is determined to do.</div>

3.12</a> Torture Porn</h3>

<!--to do--><div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/578881107?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="ATB (Active Time Battle) in FFVII Remake"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
<div>Critics who described <em>The Last of Us Part II’s</em> trailer as ‘torture porn’ were drawing attention to how confronting the image was to behold, how uncomfortable it made them feel:</div>
<blockquote class="small">…The Last of Us Part 2‘s second trailer delves into torture porn realms of excessive gore, and removed from the context of a story exploring the reasoning behind that violence it felt severely jarring to watch. (Tamburro <a href="#Tamburro 2017" target="_blank" title="Tamburro P (30 October 2017) ‘The Last of Us Part 2 and its Excessively Violent Trailer Made a Bad Impression’">2017</a>:para.2)</blockquote>
<div>These kinds of observations are informed by levels of graphical realism, for how graphic an image of violence is described to be often hinges on realism or quantities of detail. Australia’s <em>Guidelines for the Classification of Computer Games</em> says: ‘Impact [of violence] may be higher where a scene or game-play sequence contains greater detail… is realistic, rather than stylised’. And this is an accurate description of those violent images in media that seem to affect us the most, at least at the time of viewing. But these guidelines also state that ‘context is crucial in determining whether a classifiable element is justified by the story-line or themes’ (<em>Guidelines for the Classification of Computer Games</em> <a href="#Guidlines 2012" target="_blank" title="Guidelines for the Classification of Computer Games 2012 (Cth)">2012</a> (Cth) ‘The Guidelines’). And while it is true these factors can change how we feel about what we are viewing, we need to ask what these contextualisations can do to justify the reduction that has taken place through our participation. Context notwithstanding, whether the violent image is a photo, recording, performance or animation, it always asserts to be and fails to become more than what it is. To complain that an image is too gruesome and realistic, in or out of the context of some broader artistic statement, is to fully participate in the violence of the reduction just described. It is to assume that greater levels of detail and more accurately simulated blood splatters actually approach the phenomenon of violence in some way. The violent image is being rejected on the grounds of its accuracy in the absence of an explanation; it has revealed too much without context and is fetishizing. But the actual violence of this phenomenon lies in the pursuit towards realism itself and its totalizing implications, its irreverence towards otherness, and not in the spectacle of the image specifically. There is a degree to which no image of violence will ever be justified, never mind the profundity of the image’s role in some penetrating social commentary. Rather than concerning ourselves with how uncomfortable an image makes us feel, we should be concerned with the lost and unrepresentable otherness inherent in the process of image making. Within the disregard for such, lies violence.</div>

	<h3 id="3.13"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.13</a> Otherness and the Image</h3>

<div>But there is still a kind of otherness present in the event of the image. Not by virtue of anything achieved by the capturing apparatus, display or imaging technology, but through what we give to the experience. Even within a finite image, the gaze of the suffering other being conveyed can demand something from us. The image can evoke a confrontation with otherness in the abstract sense, or, in the case of war footage, it can direct us towards a distant other which has not yet been brought into focus. For, the self is an act of othering and when we orientate our sense of self in relation to an image the other is evoked in this act. Levinas (<a href="#Levinas 1969" target="_blank" title="Levinas E (1969) Totality and infinity">1969</a>:150) asserts that the other is a presupposition of the self, not just through negation but through a dialectical participation in the unity of the system. We enter into a becoming with an image, we give ourselves over to it, and there is an otherness present within that event, though it does not reside in the image as an object.</div>
		
<div>I said this otherness in the event of the image can demand something from us, and it does this in a way that is not unlike any confrontation with otherness. The suffering other, the other humans whose suffering we witness, demands an engagement from us which entails more than averting our gaze from theirs. One’s own suffering is always comprehended too keenly. It can be more than we can contain, overflowing and inexhaustible but nevertheless experienced in its entirety. The suffering other is beyond us in a different way. There is a sense in which we cannot comprehend a part of what they feel. This is how the other is able to demand something from us, by virtue of its inherent incomprehensibility. In beholding the incomprehensible suffering other there is something to answer for, namely one’s own otherness: one’s lack of suffering or how one is suffering differently. This is the foundation of Levinas’ (<a href="#Levinas 1969" target="_blank" title="Levinas E (1969) Totality and infinity">1969</a>) ethics but also his metaphysics. Encountering otherness is the presupposition of our sense of self and experience generally. So, of course the image, as a human event, entails a confrontation with otherness and we need to uncover what is peculiar to this case.</div>
	
	<h3 id="3.14"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.14</a> The Anthropological Question</h3>
		
<div>In describing the violent image, I have so far described the anthropological problem – the problem of the other and its conveyance. The pinnacle of otherness always transpires through violence and human suffering because no human phenomenon addresses the anthropological question – What is the human being? – more directly. For, that is when the existence of the human is put into question and is in a state of crisis.  Thus, the violent image ought to be regarded as a profoundly anthropological phenomenon, even a kind of naive ethnographic presentation. The anthropologist would never claim an ethnography is an exhaustive description of a people’s otherness, in no way does it approach it. It is something different entirely. The best one can do is point towards another instance of humanity with a long list of reservations and provisos. Yet this is still enough to elicit and even demand an ethical response from us. And this can also be true of the violent image.</div>
	
	<h3 id="3.15"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.15</a> Imaging Violence</h3>
		
<div><em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is a series of violent images and in this way, it presents a response to the anthropological question. But that is where its resemblance to ethnography ends. From here, it will be more productive to liken this videogame to anthropological fieldwork because players are required to participate in the generation of violent images in a more radical and explicit way than in a text or film. The primal word in videogames, for Galloway (<a href="#Galloway 2006" target="_blank" title="Galloway AR (2006) Gaming: essays on algorithmic culture">2006</a>:2), is ‘action’ because more than any other medium, a videogame is something that you do: ‘If photographs are images, and films are moving images, then video games are actions’. You push the button which triggers a murder scene. It is easier for critics to feign innocence in relation to a text because words can be made an object distinct from the volition of the person reading them. It is likewise easer to criticise the violence of a videogame you have never played and only seen the trailer for. But once you have actually played the game, some innocence has been lost because your agency has enabled the reduction of violence into a finite image, an encompassment of the other has been pretended. To understand videogame violence, one must play the game, but to play the game is to commit the reductive and totalising gesture described above, which I am arguing is violent.</div>

<div>Here I am locating videogame violence in the event of generating a violent image and not in what we identify as the image itself. One advantage of this position is how it allows us to maintain the true nature of violence as an embodied event. The body of the player plays a central role in the production of the image on the screen. The most obvious way this happens is, as has already been mentioned, by pushing a button or turning on the device.  But this also extends beyond videogames as ‘embodied and materially instantiated’ (Keogh <a href="#Keogh 2018" target="_blank" title="Keogh B (2018) A play of bodies: how we perceive videogames">2018</a>:43) phenomena. Any image presupposes eyes for it to be viewed with and the position a person needs to be in to see and understand the image. Without a body gesturing, in a specific way, towards the pixels being displayed, there is no image, only a collection of pixels (for example, it is possible to perceive the pixels in a way that occludes the image by putting your face very close to the screen). As Merleau-Ponty (<a href="#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:355) has shown, perception is an event that involves one’s entire body, every part expresses the intention and participates in coming to terms with a phenomenon. This full-body apprehension is an essential part of what a violent image is and of the violent gesture I have been identifying. In order to understand the violence of a particular phenomenon, we need to return to the body, which, as Foucault (<a href="#Foucault 1975" target="_blank" title="Foucault M (1975/1995) Discipline and punish: the birth of the prison">1975/1995</a>:26) has famously argued, is the plane on which ‘relations of power and domination’ are produced.</div>
		
<div>To forget this aspect of violence, to ‘veil the body’ (Todes <a href="#Todes 2001" target="_blank" title="Todes S (2001) Body and world">2001</a>:29) in such a way, constitutes an irreverence towards the body of the suffering other – which is the essence of violence. This is an idea that will always need to be returned to: bodily circumstances must be made explicit to contemplate and confront violence. But since Descartes (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>), it has been possible to avoid a confrontation with the body by disregarding it for the conditions of having experience in general (Todes <a href="#Todes 2001" target="_blank" title="Todes S (2001) Body and world">2001</a>:38). To live in one’s body, as Cartesian dualism makes possible, enables a retreat from the ramifications of our bodily circumstances. The Cartesian stance holds that violence and survival might be necessary for the sake of my body, but that is not what I am fundamentally, and it does not describe the transcendental base of things. This has enabled Western philosophy to avoid a confrontation with the suffering body of the other. This is how idealism leads to a detachment which enables an ignorance of violence, as was expressed in Rosenzweig’s (<a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>)  criticism of Hegel (<a href="#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>); the body has no place in Hegel’s pursuit of the absolute cognition of the all, fear of death is denied along with an acknowledgement of the suffering other. These bodies and the violence they experience have been occluded in Hegel’s grand narrative of dialectical notions. Spirit consumes everything, its progress is inevitable and the violence the body receives and the violence it commits is a non-issue.</div>
	
	<h3 id="3.16"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.16</a> Veiling the Body (Two Ways)</h3>
		
<div>Dismissing videogame violence as a mere image on one hand, or an accurate depiction of human suffering on the other both veil the body in a similar way. The first removes the role of the body in the experience of the image entirely while the second reduces the body of the suffering other to the confines of an image. But, as I have been saying, videogame violence is not something transpiring on the screen and the suffering other cannot be contained within an image. Violence, including the reductive violence present in the generation of an image, is something we do with our bodies. We are beyond considering the image as an object; it must be understood as an action, an imaging. In videogames, the essence of the violence transpiring lies dialogically within the volition of the player and game developers.</div>

<div>Violence is always more complicated than what an image can present it to be. We did not just slit this character’s throat, we gave ourselves, our bodies, over to the production of a finite image of a person dealing with extreme otherness, affirming their sense of self, struggling for survival and dying. And we have conquered this horizon of otherness by bringing an end to it, by effectively saying: ‘this is all there is’. We have delved into alterity with the tip of our blade and when we were done, all we found was an image of a corpse. We did this, not as an image of Ellie sticking her knife in someone, but with our own bodies we confronted an otherness. We have painted a picture of the suffering other and said, ‘Here is the answer to the anthropological question. This is what the human is. I can show it with a gesture, and I can count how many pixels it took to answer the question’.</div>

3.18</a> <strong>Interlude</strong>: Virtual Reality is an Anthropological Problem</h3>
		
	<h4 id="3.18.1"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.18.1</a> The Goal</h4>
			
<div>The goal of this interlude is to frame VR (Virtual Reality) as an anthropological problem. This framing requires a broad look at the phenomenon, with a focus on its roots and potential in relation to the human. To participate in the experience of VR is to opt into a philosophical demonstration, which reinforces early ideas in Western Philosophy that are still directing and motivating the development of VR and other technologies today. It will become clear that these ideas cannot be fully extracted from the phenomenon of VR as a lived human experience. To consider VR in isolation, as a mere entertainment apparatus, is to occlude the narrative we draw from to give the experience meaning. Alternatively, to approach the history of ideas that have led to the development of VR, without taking into consideration the actual lived experience of using the technology, misses the mediums potential as a plane of human expression. An anthropological approach considers the human, as problematic, first, making space for an investigation of VR as both agent and manifestation of historical process. VR is revealed to be an expression of an ambition which is not historically unique, but which is being accomplished in unprecedented ways. That is, in this essay we use VR to answer the question – What is the human? – and observe what this expression of humanity can teach us.</div>
		
	<h4 id="3.18.2"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.18.2</a> VR is an Immersive, Interactive and Computated Experience</h4>

<div>In her book, <em>Narrative as Virtual Reality</em>, Ryan (<a href="#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>) describes VR as ‘an immersive, interactive experience generated by a computer’ (Ryan <a href="#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>:12). For Ryan, immersion and interaction are two overlapping and crucial components, central to the experience that is VR. Though Ryan (<a href="#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>:69-72) will later go on to incorporate the ideas in Merleau-Ponty’s (<a href="#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>) <em>Phenomenology of Perception</em> into her description of VR, her initial definition is standard.</div>
			
<div>Merleau-Ponty’s critique of Descartes (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) rejected the idea of a ‘sensation as pure impression’ (Merleau-Ponty <a href="#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>:4), but VR entails the creation of sense data in the form of a pixel or a bladder in a haptic glove. Unlike Merleau-Ponty’s critique, these quantifiable characteristics are inescapably tied to the notion of VR as, computated immersion. VR is defined as a phenomenon that is in pursuit of a ceiling, an assumption that perception is only a matter of information in high enough quantities. It is a perspective described by Buber’s (<a href="#Buber 1923" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1923/1987) I and thou">1923/1987</a>) I-It orientation towards the world, <s>which is to scientifically view objects as the causers of experience</s>. In this sense, VR becomes an act of substitution and capture.</div>
			
<div>VR is often marketed as a ‘disembodiment’ or form of escapism and to whatever degree such is the case, it is also embodied and immanent. The experience of ‘transcendence’ is achieved through finite means. As far as we regard VR to consist of this gesture, it is a dismissal of Buber’s (<a href="#Buber 1923" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1923/1987) I and thou">1923/1958</a>) famous I-Thou stance, which is to acknowledge that human life ‘does not consist merely of activities that have something for their object’. Though particulars vary, in VR the direction and focus is fixed on the subject in a way that maintains a mind-body dualism. This emphasis is consistent, though some are more explicit than others. Thus, Ryan (<a href="#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>), as well as Kipman (<a href="#Kipman 2017" target="_blank" title="Kipman A (3 October 2017) ‘The era of Windows Mixed Reality begins October 17’">2017</a>) and Moravec (<a href="#Moravec 1998" target="_blank" title="Moravec H (1998) ‘Simulation, Consciousness, Existence’">1998</a>) which will be discussed below, demonstrate that to work with, participate in and even describe VR in its own terms, is to adopt ‘the point of view of the body-object… sensation seems to be a communication’ (Marcel <a href="#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:26). When VR is both finite (computated) and immersive (approaching the inexhaustible scope of lived human experience), we see that VR-the-technology is very specific to certain conditions of modernity.</div>

<div>We can identify the demonstration of particular values and beliefs about reality when people are defining what VR is. For example, when Heim (<a href="#Heim 1994" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (1994) The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality">1994</a>; <a href="#Heim 1998" target="_blank" title="Heim, MR 1998, Virtual Realism">1998</a>:3-5) ties up the various loose ends of his definition, it contains statements that are deliberately metaphysical (so he describes them, and such is the name of his book) and also deeper presumptions that make those statements possible. Heim (<a href="#Heim 1998" target="_blank" title="Heim, MR 1998, Virtual Realism">1998</a>:3) presents VR in the ‘weak’ and ‘strong sense’. The former is identified in the prevalence of VR in the language used to refer to technology more broadly. Anything from TVs, video games or a new car might be described as ‘virtual reality’ in the right context. Heim’s (<a href="#Heim 1998" target="_blank" title="Heim, MR 1998, Virtual Realism">1998</a>:3) ‘strong sense’ provides an example of metaphysical exposition within a definition of VR. It is a definition that has directed Heim’s (<a href="#Heim 1998" target="_blank" title="Heim, MR 1998, Virtual Realism">1998</a>) work as a philosopher since he presented it in his book, The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality, more than twenty years ago. Heim’s (<a href="#Heim 1998" target="_blank" title="Heim, MR 1998, Virtual Realism">1998</a>:7) ‘three “I”s of virtual reality’ — ‘immersion, interactivity and information intensity’ — likely inspired Ryan’s (<a href="#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>:12) definition, but while Ryan (<a href="#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>:20) is ultimately willing to treat VR as ‘a metaphor for total art’, Heim does not deviate from VR-the-technology. According to Heim (<a href="#Heim 1998" target="_blank" title="Heim, MR 1998, Virtual Realism">1998</a>:7), VR in the ‘strong sense’ did not emerge until ‘computers became powerful enough to control several input/output devices that feed information in and out of the human body’.</div>

<div>Heim (<a href="#Heim 2017a" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017a) VR Third WAVE: Book One of Virtual Reality Metaphysics">2017a</a>) describes VR as an ideal. This is demonstrated in his recent series of books under the title, Virtual Reality Metaphysics. He sees VR as ‘a tool for enlightenment’ and ‘a pathway to a heightened sense of reality’ that ‘touches spiritual and metaphysical depths’ (Heim <a href="#Heim 2017a" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017a) VR Third WAVE: Book One of Virtual Reality Metaphysics">2017a</a>:para.1). Heim’s recent books are a guide to help users get more out of their virtual reality experiences and draw on ‘Renaissance magic’, phenomenology, psychology and ancient Gnosticism:</div>
<blockquote class="small">Through heightened awareness of the primal elements of experience, the cybernaut or VR traveler, like the Renaissance magus, aims for psychological balance by applying simple meditative techniques post headset immersion. (Heim <a href="#Heim 2017b" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017) ‘Bridging Real and Virtual: A Spiritual Challenge’">2017b</a>:7)</blockquote>
<div>This is how Heim describes it in a recent article in which he addresses the anxiety associated with ‘technological Platonism’ not far removed from Baudrillard (<a href="#Baudrillard 1981" target="_blank" title="Baudrillard J (1981/2020) Simulacra and simulation">1981/2020</a>). The anxiety that comes out of the fear of the ‘virtual-as-fake’ (Ryan <a href="#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>:27) will (or in Baudrillard’s case, already has) ‘entrap users in a fascination with a perfect world… thus eclipsing the actual imperfect material world’ (Heim <a href="#Heim 2017b" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017) ‘Bridging Real and Virtual: A Spiritual Challenge’">2017b</a>:162). But Heim sees VR experiences as a transcendental means of coming to terms with the immanent in a fuller sense. His notion of ‘bridging real and virtual’ still regards them as separate domains, which can be reconnected to prevent anxiety or disorientation by representing the four elements as touchstones in 3D virtual environments (Heim <a href="#Heim 2017b" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017) ‘Bridging Real and Virtual: A Spiritual Challenge’">2017b</a>:177). For Heim, VR experiences are immersive and ‘realistic’ enough to result in a bodily disorientation and existential anxiety, but they can also apparently teach us things about actual reality, though not in a way that is scientific: ‘The procedure is magical (associational) rather than rational, symbolic rather than literal, phenomenological rather than objective, and ritualistic rather than technological’ (Heim <a href="#Heim 2017b" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017) ‘Bridging Real and Virtual: A Spiritual Challenge’">2017b</a>:177). In this way, Heim provides an example of how VR is generating new concepts within the scientific means that make the technology possible in the first place. He sees transcendental value in the VR experience, though it can be contextualised as a reductive gesture based on the assumption that perception is quantifiable. Of course, we can review Heim’s SOURCES and take his historical analyses of Western thought seriously. But his ideas also seem to be a reaction to the experience of VR itself. Heim’s work is an expression of the human phenomenon we are trying to understand.</div>

<div>Heim (<a href="#Heim 2017b" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017) ‘Bridging Real and Virtual: A Spiritual Challenge’">2017b</a>) shows how the notion of VR, as both a technology and ideal, entails a set of metaphysical assumptions and values that need to be identified. What is pre-reflective about VR can be framed using a number of overlapping concepts that underlie the conscious articulation of a metaphysics— social imaginary, conditions of belief (Taylor <a href="#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>), milieu, sense of self (Taylor <a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>), lifeworld (Husserl <a href="#Husserl 1982" target="_blank" title="Husserl E (1982) Cartesian Meditations: An Introduction to Phenomenology">1982</a>) or ontology, as a set of pre-reflective assumptions about the world (Kapferer <a href="#Kapferer 1988" target="_blank" title="Kapferer B (1988/2012) Legends of people, myths of state: violence, intolerance, and political culture in Sri Lanka and Australia">2012</a>:79-80).</div>

3.18.3</a> VR is a Philosophical Demonstration</h4>
			
<div>Alex Kipman (<a href="#Kipman 2017" target="_blank" title="Kipman A (3 October 2017) ‘The era of Windows Mixed Reality begins October 17’">2017</a>:para.3), a Technical Fellow at Microsoft, revealed the company’s virtual reality platform, Windows Mixed Reality, with the following observation:</div>
<blockquote class="small">We are standing at the threshold of the next revolution in computing. A revolution where computers empower us to expand our capabilities and transcend time, space, and devices.</blockquote>
<div>The ambition behind this statement is something to behold and it is possible to treat Kipman’s description of a ‘revolution of computing’ as a metaphysical statement: his language seems to assume that space and time are finite and can be ‘transcended’ by manipulating the subject through technology, and human perception is conflated with what has ontological value. Of course, Kipman, here, is not formally attempting a metaphysics, only a sales pitch; in this light, it would be inaccurate to regard his ‘space’ and ‘time’ as universal concepts. This contextualisation notwithstanding, even a ‘renegotiation’ in the most limited sense will have a dramatic impact on the way people think about the world. Advancements in transportation, for example, have certainly altered the way we think about space and time (Chan <a href="#Chan 2014" target="_blank" title="Chan M (2014) Virtual reality: representations on contemporary media">2014</a>:5). Works I have already cited by Benjamin (<a href="#Benjamin 1931" target="_blank" title="Benjamin W (1931/2015) ‘Small history of photography’">1931/2015</a>), Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1985" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1985/2003) Cinema 2: the time image">1985/2003</a>; <a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>), etc. certainly speak to the potential that a new creative medium has to bring about a ‘renegotiation’ that approaches Kipman’s (<a href="#Kipman 2017" target="_blank" title="Kipman A (3 October 2017) ‘The era of Windows Mixed Reality begins October 17’">2017</a>) above description of VR. It does not take a formal metaphysics to fulfil the kind of sweeping ontological shifts Kipman is describing here. Even the most ambitious philosophers — whose intention appears to be something close to this (Kant <a href="#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>, Hegel <a href="#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>, etc.) — could not achieve that fast and sweeping influence attributed to technological innovations.</div>

<div>Since Descartes (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>), Western Philosophy has seen significant developments and departures from what was detailed in <em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em>. Yet, as Dreyfus (<a href="#Dreyfus 1992" target="_blank" title="Dreyfus HL (1992) What computers still can’t do: a critique of artificial reason">1992</a>) has demonstrated, the works of Husserl (<a href="#Husserl 1970" target="_blank" title="Husserl E (1970) The crisis of european sciences and transcendental phenomenology: an introduction to phenomenological philosophy">1970</a>), Heidegger (<a href="#Heidegger 1927" target="_blank" title="Heidegger M (1927/2008) Being and time">1927/2008</a>) or Merleau-Ponty (<a href="#Merleau-Ponty 1945" target="_blank" title="Merleau-Ponty M (1945/2012) Phenomenology of perception">1945/2012</a>) have done nothing to stifle the ambitions of those who are attempting to replicate reality in a way that is tied to Cartesian assumptions. On one hand, we had the canonical fathers of Western philosophy like Descartes (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) and Kant (<a href="#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of Pure Reason">1781/2007</a>) trying to build a metaphysics compatible with the overwhelming successes of the sciences, which resulted in an epistemological turn (Taylor <a href="#Taylor 1995" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1995) Philosophical arguments">1995</a>). On the other hand, today and for quite some time now, we have what might be called the reverse. Through technologies like VR and artificial intelligence (fruits of the scientific method) we can identify an effort to validate and demonstrate the values central to epistemological projects of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, i.e. rationalism, objectivity and a particular conception of the mind. But this is not to be interpreted as an attempt to epistemologically re-establish what philosophy – which was once the ‘most basic’ and ‘foundational disciple’ (Rorty <a href="#Rorty 1979" target="_blank" title="Rorty R (1979) Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature">1979</a>:132) – is now failing to achieve. That is, aspirations for VR are more than a compensation for or reaction against postmodern ideas threatening scientific methods.</div>
			
<div>VR does not only reflect a Cartesian desire to correctly represent an independent reality; it is no longer a matter of accurate representation but replication. While Taylor (<a href="#Taylor 1995" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1995) Philosophical arguments">1995</a>:3) has traced the connections between this latter conception of knowledge tied to epistemology and the ‘…notions about science and about the nature of human agency [connecting] with certain central moral and spiritual ideas of the modern age’, VR seems to demonstrate that these values run deeper still and in ways that have escaped the historical or genealogical approaches of Taylor and other authors who have attempted similar projects (for example, Blumenberg <a href="#Blumenberg 1985" target="_blank" title="Blumenberg H (1985) The Legitimacy of the Modern Age">1985</a>, Foucault <a href="#Foucault 1966" target="_blank" title="Foucault M (1966/2005) The order of things: an archaeology of the human sciences">2005</a>, Habermas <a href="#Habermas 1991" target="_blank" title="Habermas J (1991) The structural transformation of the public sphere: an inquiry into a category of bourgeois society">1991</a>). The experience of using VR provides its own type of response to these authors theses regarding the progress of modernity and its achievements, which precedes any historical narrative we might employ to problematize it.</div>
			
<div>VR seems to invite philosophical speculation in the way it presents itself as a demonstration of both the future of humanity and the fundamental principles underlying reality. Much of this has to do with the way VR performs the approach of a limit that has implications for reality as a whole. Elon Musk’s (<a href="#Musk 2017" target="_blank" title="Musk E (17 February 2018) ‘Are We In A Simulation? - Elon Musk’ [video]">2018</a>:<a href="https://youtu.be/xBKRuI2zHp0?t=125" target="_blank">2'05"</a>) popular case for the simulation argument demonstrates how VR, as a movement, is creating space for fresh articulations of old philosophical ideas:</div>
<blockquote class="small">given that we’re clearly on a trajectory to have games that are indistinguishable from reality… it would seem to follow that the odds that we’re in base reality is one in billions.</blockquote>
<div>This is similar to Hans Moravec’s (<a href="#Moravec 1998" target="_blank" title="Moravec H (1998) ‘Simulation, Consciousness, Existence’">1998</a>) simulation argument, in which he describes VR’s trajectory towards a perfect simulation as something that resembles Descartes’s (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) ‘evil demon who created the illusion of an external reality by controlling all that we see and hear’ (Moravec <a href="#Moravec 1998" target="_blank" title="Moravec H (1998) ‘Simulation, Consciousness, Existence’">1998</a>:para.3).</div>
			
<div>While this hypothetical inspired Descartes to rebut that ‘I am, I exist… is necessarily true’ (Descartes <a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>:24), Moravec’s reflections on the same suggestion lead to an overflowing of sentience; ‘the thermal jostling of the atoms in a rock can be seen as the operation of a complex, self-aware mind’ (Moravec <a href="#Moravec 1998" target="_blank" title="Moravec H (1998) ‘Simulation, Consciousness, Existence’">1998</a>:para.24). Though both revere mathematics, Moravec is led away from Descartes’s conclusions to a ‘platonic realism’ and ‘virtualization of the experiencer’ (Ryan <a href="#Ryan 2001" target="_blank" title="Ryan M (2001) Narrative as virtual reality: immersion and interactivity in literature and electronic media">2001</a>:31).  It then follows that to the degree improvements in technology continue to approach this state, the significance of reality is reduced, thereby undermining the legitimacy and value of traditional metaphysics like Kant’s (<a href="#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>).</div>

<div>The ambition of the sciences has shifted from objectively examining the world as it presents itself, to replicating the world in order to demonstrate what underlies it or the lack thereof. Lévy (<a href="#Lévy 1990" target="_blank" title="Lévy P (1990) Les technologies de l'intelligence. l'avenir de la pensée à l'ère informatique">1990</a>) described this shift of focus from cause and effect to the resemblance of a simulation in his book Les technologies de l’intelligence. Lévy explores the way new computer technologies are changing the way we think about problems and what we accept as solutions (Malina <a href="#Malina 1992" target="_blank" title="Malina, RF 1992, ‘Les Technologies De L’intelligence: L’avenir De La Pensee A L’ere Informatique (The Technologies Of Intelligence: The Future Of Thought In The Computer Age) by Pierre Levy (review)’">1992</a>). The goal is no longer to observe but to create a simulation that resembles the original as closely as possible. This is to reveal hidden characteristics that could not have been accessed any other way and amounts to a radical shift in perspective, a lack of submission to natural forces. We can see these shifts in the way VR and computer simulations are interpreted, by Moravec (<a href="#Moravec 1998" target="_blank" title="Moravec H (1998) ‘Simulation, Consciousness, Existence’">1998</a>) and others (Bostrom <a href="#Bostrom 2003" target="_blank" title="Bostrom, N 2003, ‘Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?’">2003</a>, Chalmers <a href="#Chalmers 1990" target="_blank" title="Chalmers, DJ 1990, How Cartesian Dualism Might Have Been True">1990</a>, Weatherson <a href="#Weatherson 2003" target="_blank" title="Weatherson, B 2003, ‘Are you a sim?’">2003</a>) as a demonstration of the otherwise inaccessible fundamental characteristics of reality. The way people seem to interpret VR as a potential explanation for reality itself, says a lot about the changing ways we are thinking about some timeless problems.</div>
			
<div>In this way, VR is regarded as something of an answer to certain ontological questions made imperative by the conditions of modern society. This was demonstrated at a virtual reality event I went to in Melbourne, early 2018. I sat in the audience listening to a panel of VR filmmakers as they answered questions about the challenges they face in the new medium — like managing the inherent level of autonomy that gives each user a different experience. The person hosting the event finished with some questions of her own along these same lines, but I found her last question to be very unexpected and completely irrelevant to the discussion they had been having up to that point. She asked the members of the panel if they thought we were approaching, at some point in the future, a VR experience that is indistinguishable from reality. Their speculative and unflinching responses seemed to generate more interest than the previous discussions regarding the process and technical challenges of creating a VR film itself. Socialising after the event led me to believe that discussions about the future of VR and what that might reveal about the nature of reality are what most people had come to the event for in the first place. The position of progress celebrated and demonstrated through technological innovation cannot escape what Blumenberg (<a href="#Blumenberg 1985" target="_blank" title="Blumenberg H (1985) The Legitimacy of the Modern Age">1985</a>) described as the unanswered questions of the previous era, and it seems natural and exciting to apply our new experiences to the oldest of questions, especially when those experiences are as provocative and confounding as VR. Thus, VR inspires a type of metaphysical contemplation because it is itself a metaphysical statement or demonstration that is profoundly novel.</div>

<div>It is possible to view VR as a re-enactment of the values tied to the methodologies descended from Descartes (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) but this historical construal does not resemble a ‘renegotiation’ like Kipman’s (<a href="#Kipman 2017" target="_blank" title="Kipman A (3 October 2017) ‘The era of Windows Mixed Reality begins October 17’">2017</a>), it only amounts to a philosophical demonstration that is an affirmation of the scientific method’s ability to capture reality to the utmost, to quantify it in a kind of reductive positivism. However, while it is reasonable to place VR at the end of a particular ‘master narrative’ (Taylor <a href="#Taylor 1995" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1995) Philosophical arguments">1995</a>::291, 315) a science that ‘disenchants’ (Weber <a href="#Weber 1905" target="_blank" title="Weber M (1905/2001) The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">2001</a>) and captures the world, this says nothing about how VR is influencing those same ideological and ontological premises the technology is an expression of. In Moravec (<a href="#Moravec 1998" target="_blank" title="Moravec H (1998) ‘Simulation, Consciousness, Existence’">1998</a>) and Musk’s (<a href="#Musk 2017" target="_blank" title="Musk E (17 February 2018) ‘Are We In A Simulation? - Elon Musk’ [video]">2018</a>) simulation arguments, Cartesianism still seems very present, VR as still an extension of the abounding successes of the physical sciences. To regrade VR as a demonstration of technology’s ability to capture, by means of replication, every aspect of the human experience might even be called an extreme application of Descartes’s methodological scepticism and dualism. But these ideas are being expressed in new contexts, through different mediums and are finding novel conclusions, as we have already seen in Moravec’s (<a href="#Moravec 1998" target="_blank" title="Moravec H (1998) ‘Simulation, Consciousness, Existence’">1998</a>: para.1) ‘physical fundamentalism’ and Heim’s (<a href="#Heim 2017b" target="_blank" title="Heim MR (2017) ‘Bridging Real and Virtual: A Spiritual Challenge’">2017b</a>) SOURCES to Buddhism and Gnosticism are another example. These give a preliminary picture of the different shades of ideas that have motivated VR as a broad phenomenon, and also how individuals are incorporating the experience of VR into their understanding of the world and themselves.</div>

	<h4 id="3.18.4"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.18.4</a> VR is an Individualism</h4>
			
<div>Taylor (<a href="#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>; <a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>) has described the modern sense of self extensively by contextualising it within a broad historical narrative. In Sources of the Self (Taylor <a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>), he sets out to describe modern individualism and the values associated with it via the history of Western thought and in A Secular Age Taylor (<a href="#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>) employs a similar method, this time in order to describe the ‘conditions of belief’ in modern secular pluralism. To convey the drastic changes that have contributed to our current understanding of ourselves and the world, Taylor (<a href="#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>:35) contrasts the ‘buffered self’ we experience today to the more ‘porous’ understanding of the self our ancestors had. This ‘porousness’ can be identified in the fears people had of being possessed but extends to general explanations for emotional states as well. This is something that has been demonstrated in anthropology. Divinity and Experience paints ultra-human forces that have the potential to permeate every facet of a person’s physical and psychological state (Lienhardt <a href="#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>). Free divinities might enter a person at any time taking over their body or if the Dinka wish ill of another person, tying a knot around a tuft of grass might hinder them (Lienhardt <a href="#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>:282). One of Lienhardt’s contemporaries at Oxford might question the connection between the individual and the grass. In this way, their understanding of self and agency is ‘buffered’. Lienhardt’s descriptions throw our own immunity or buffered state into relief.  Taylor (<a href="#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>:37) describes the ‘buffered self’ with the following example:</div>
<blockquote class="small">A modern is feeling depressed, melancholy. He is told: it’s just your body chemistry, you’re hungry, or there is a hormone malfunction, or whatever. Straightaway, he feels relieved. He can take a distance from this feeling, which is ipso facto declared not justiﬁed. Things don’t really have this meaning it just feels this way, which is the result of a causal action utterly unrelated to the meanings of things. This step of disengagement depends on our modern mind/body distinction, and the relegation of the physical to being ‘just’ a contingent cause of the psychic.</blockquote>
<div>This buffered state can be a source of encouragement – my life is not really that bad, I just have a chemical imbalance – or crippling accountability – I am not the victim of possession, there is something wrong with me. The former was the focus of Taylor’s example and ‘depends on our modern mind/body distinction’ but the latter describes the objectification of a subject; a person has become a problem to be fixed. Whatever ideals we strive for, as buffered selves, must either be achieved through a manipulation and dehumanisation of the subject-as-problem or through a manipulation of our own environment. This applies to political issues too. That is, we do not appeal to any ultra-human powers to accomplish social change. We might regard a group of people to be incorrect or victims of particular inequalities, and we can complicate the story as much as we like, moving the causes of whatever issue we have in mind further into the past creating a history of thought or genealogy of ideas. But all this really amounts to is a shift of that crippling accountability associated with the buffered self, further into the past, or further into our brains.</div>

<div>In this way, VR is a reaction to or expression of this ‘disenchanted’ state. I can explain whatever resistances I encounter in life through the lens of exclusive humanism and I can do so in a way that is empowering, but that empowerment depends on a separation of myself from my environment, body or brain – it entails a kind of dualism. VR is an example of Taylor’s (<a href="#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>) exclusive humanism completely following through with this idea, maintaining a hyper-individualism, dealing with the accountability of the buffered self through a form of extreme escapism – an escapism that uses scientific methodologies to manipulate the subject. It is the ultimate accommodation for a lack of ultra-human forces for our isolated and buffered individualist state.</div>
			
<div>VR is an extreme expression of modern individualism in many ways. One way of countering individualist ideologies, if you are inclined to do so, is to draw attention to what Taylor (<a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:36) calls ‘webs of interlocution’. This is in the way my sense of self depends on my relations to particular interlocutors, not only in relation to language but even the meaning and value I derive from my individuality depends on the other. The self needs a structure that is both social and moral to exist, and in this context, Descartes’ (<a href="#Descrates 1641" target="_blank" title="Descartes R (1641/2003) Meditations and other metaphysical writings">1641/2003</a>) cogito loses meaning. VR can be seen as a means of giving the isolated cogito structure. It is not ‘psychological adjustment’ but an external accommodation, a fulfilment of individualisation in a way that is not dependent on the other. It is the ultimate affirmation of the modern sense of self Taylor is describing. If I pick up a rock on the beach, I can study it and contemplate the seemingly infinite number of contingencies through space and time that have contributed to the composition of that rock and my having chanced upon it. This thought has implications for my identity and prominence in the scheme of the universe. A program in VR can be created to simulate that experience, but in the computated world where it takes place, I am at the true centre. Even if rocks are generated by an algorithm randomly all those rocks exist for me; my gaze summons them into existence. It is like a miniature idealism has been constructed within and by a scientific positivism.</div>
			
<div>This draws attention to a strange dissonance within modern ideals and valued epistemologies. The more I embrace the objectivity of the universe as a means of self-affirmation and intellectual maturity, enacting the values of a hyper-individualism, the smaller I become (Marcel <a href="#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>:20; Schrempp <a href="#Schrempp 2012" target="_blank" title="Schrempp G (2012) The ancient mythology of modern science: a mythologist looks (seriously) at popular science writing">2012</a>:218). My sense of self is threatened by the crushing weight of an indifferent universe. VR, however, reinforces the value of the self while also being a demonstration of how robust scientific methodologies are. Of course, VR is still a communicative act and still constitutes a ‘web of interlocution’, but the gesture of VR is to occlude those traits in a way that reinforces individualism while also asserting a type of dominance over the universe. VR is an elaborate way of achieving both seemingly incompatible values and notwithstanding the cost.</div>

3.18.5</a> VR is a Moral Value</h4>
			
<div>This cost might be a disillusionment, a moral fragmentation described by Alasdair MacIntyre (<a href="#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>) or temporal disorientation conveyed in Löwith’s (<a href="#Löwith 1957" target="_blank" title="Löwith K (1957) Meaning in history: the theological implications of the philosophy of history">1957</a>) work – the ‘malaise of modernity’ (Taylor <a href="#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>:299). MacIntyre (<a href="#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>:111) paints the modern moral landscape as an assembly of morals and ideals from disparate sources that are fundamentally incompatible. Enlightenment projects embraced many aspects of Aristotelian ethics while rejecting the teleological contexts they emerged from. Just as King Kamehameha II was able to abolish taboos without resistance in Hawaii because they were no longer couched in a context that gave them meaning, MacIntyre (<a href="#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>:111) calls Nietzsche (<a href="#Nietzsche 1882" target="_blank" title="Nietzsche F (1882/2008) The gay science">1882/2008</a>) the ‘King Kamehameha II of the European tradition’:</div>
<blockquote class="small">For it was Nietzsche's historic achievement to understand more clearly than any other philosopher… not only that what purported to be appeals to objectivity were in fact expressions of subjective will, but also the nature of the problems that this posed for moral philosophy. (MacIntyre <a href="#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>:113)</blockquote>
<div>Enlightenment ethics, like Kant’s (<a href="#Kant 1785" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1785/2002) Groundwork for the metaphysics of morals">1785/2002</a>) moral philosophy, which says we must always treat people as ends in themselves and never as a means, can only be naively upheld in a Weberian bureaucratic context of emotivism. Because Weber (<a href="#Weber 1905" target="_blank" title="Weber M (1905/2001) The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">2001</a>) finds all values to be equally non-rational, the responsibility is then placed on the individual to simply choose. However, there is no system in place to determine how those values ought to be deduced, save only, in many cases, the capitalist mechanism of bureaucracy. But these systems hardly fulfil Kant’s (<a href="#Kant 1785" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1785/2002) Groundwork for the metaphysics of morals">1785/2002</a>) categorical imperative to not treat people as means and subjectivism prevents any values from being universally applied. The moral foundations of any modern bureaucratic culture contain ‘suppressed Nietzschean premises’ (MacIntyre<a href="#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>:114) and Weber’s description of values was no exception (MacIntyre <a href="#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>:26). In a moral landscape like the one Nietzsche recognised, absent of any real objectivity the Ubermensch becomes the new imperative, we must become ‘human beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves’ (Nietzsche <a href="#Nietzsche 1882" target="_blank" title="Nietzsche F (1882/2008) The gay science">1882/2008</a>:189).</div>
			
<div>We should recognise this Nietzschean value in the philosophy behind VR. Crawford (<a href="#Crawford 2015" target="_blank" title="Crawford MB (2015) 'Virtual reality as moral ideal'">2015</a>:32) associates virtual reality broadly with Kant’s (<a href="#Kant 1785" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1785/2002) Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals">1785/2002</a>) moral philosophy in the way virtual technology is designed to liberate Reason from whatever might be obstructing it in physical reality. But VR often betrays this value, for as it strives to be a technology that enables the clearest expression of our wills the means by which this is accomplished entails an objectification of the individual, through both capitalist consumer contexts and also through the way VR seeks to manipulate and control human perception. In this way, it is more accurate to associate VR with Nietzsche’s (<a href="#Nietzsche 1882" target="_blank" title="Nietzsche F (1882/2008) The gay science">1882/2008</a>) moral philosophy or at least the ‘suppressed Nietzschean premises’ MacIntyre (<a href="#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>) has identified in bureaucratic enterprises generally. There is a dissonance between the ideals sought for and the means by which they are achieved in the VR industry.</div>
			
<div>This has some implications for VR in the way it is strived for as a utopian ideal. Our society still holds to a particular kind of eschatology that is embedded in the institutions of modern science, though this is not essential to any scientific method based on observation and hypothetico-deductive reasoning. Scientific methods depend on an unknown and a lack of resolution and this is something Kant (<a href="#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>) reinforced in his metaphysics. Just as Kant (<a href="#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>) describes, this dependency has not discouraged many scientific aspirations (as we see in the ‘Transcendental Dialectic’; Kant <a href="#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>:285-549), nor has it discouraged the actioning of an eschatology through scientific means; this is what VR is.</div>
			
<div>We can see these aspirations visibly being demonstrated in rhetoric pertaining to a virtual utopia, a future of humanity that has fully overcome all resistance pertinent to the human condition. Löwith (<a href="#Löwith 1957" target="_blank" title="Löwith K (1957) Meaning in history: the theological implications of the philosophy of history">1957</a>) presented a Heideggerian style historical analyses of the history of the philosophy of history, working his way backward from Burckhardt (<a href="#Burckhardt 1943" target="_blank" title="Burckhardt J (1943) Refections on history">1943</a>) to the <em>Bible</em> to reveal the eschatological roots of Western philosophy’s conception of History. This can also be identified in Western projections of the future and VR emerges and finds value as a demonstration of that trajectory. Like many technologies, VR reinforces a narrative of progress. Beyond demonstrating a particular set of beliefs about reality, VR demonstrates the approach of an ideal that is based on the moral premises of Western culture. Though, as MacIntyre (<a href="#MacIntyre 1981" target="_blank" title="MacIntyre A (1981/2007) After virtue: a study in moral theory">1981/2007</a>) has demonstrated, these premises are deeply flawed, they are ‘fragmented’ in a way that constitutes the peculiar conditions of secular pluralism.</div>
			
<div>Part of Taylor’s (<a href="#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>) thesis is that there is something fundamentally disorientating about secular pluralism, the unprecedented coexistence of irreconcilable worldviews. We can view VR as a technology that has emerged out of and in response to these conditions, it is the ultimate liberation of the individual physically, mentally and morally. Morally, not just in the way VR enables individuals to perform violent acts or virtual sex without consequence – these aspirations are present but not central to the culture of VR enthusiasts I am currently aware of – morally, in the way these deeply inform our conceptions of self. Hence, Taylor (<a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:4) uses the term, ‘strong evaluations’ to convey a broader moral picture that extends beyond questions of right and wrong and into questions regarding what constitutes a good life, what is worthy of praise beyond aesthetics, ‘a moral reaction is an assent to, an affirmation of, a given ontology of the human’ (Taylor <a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>:5). When the question of morals is viewed more broadly in this way, it is easy to see how VR entails a very clear picture of these ‘strong evaluations’. They are thrown into relief because the whole point of VR is to provide an escape to an ideal which people have of human existence.</div>
			
<div>It must be acknowledged that most instances of VR have value because they are not real. If a shooting game felt too real, for example, the experience would lose value and the user would become terrified and experience the same kind of trauma as real war. But these examples might only demonstrate the dissonance present in our moral condition, an inconsistency in the things we are reaching for and in what positively reinforces our sense of self. VR seems to reveal inconsistencies in the way it is an elaborate accommodation for them.</div>
		
	<h4 id="3.18.6"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.18.6</a> VR is an Anthropology</h4>
			
<div>VR, as a phenomenon, has perhaps been overlooked by anthropologists thanks to an assumed definition that prevents it from becoming a topic in itself. We see these kinds of descriptions of VR in Boellstorff’s (<a href="#Boellstorff 2008" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtual human">2008</a>; <a href="#Boellstorff 2014" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2014) ‘An afterward in four binarisms’">2014</a>; <a href="#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>) work when he differentiates virtual reality from ‘virtual worlds’. The latter have ‘persistent contexts of social immersion’ (Boellstorff <a href="#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:395) and are presented as ‘alternative realities’ with real social and political import — <em>Facebook</em> and <em>Second Life</em> (Linden Lab <a href="#Linden Lab 2003" target="_blank" title="Linden Lab (developer) (2003) Second Life [videogame]">2003</a>) are two examples of ‘virtual worlds’. Boellstorff (<a href="#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:387) insists upon their social reality, and thus their value as topics of inquiry for anthropologists and beyond. VR is employed as a means of defining virtual worlds and then left aside, it is what distracts us from the ‘alternative realities’ that need investigation —  ‘a ﬂight simulator run from a single computer not connected to the internet… is not a virtual world, because it disappears when the computer is turned off’ (Boellstorff <a href="#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:395). Compared to virtual worlds, the notion of VR has no essential social continuity. In this way, VR is less interesting to the social scientist or anthropologist and would best be left to the phenomenologist or psychologist concerned with sensory experience. But the gestures implicit in the idea of VR — its social, political and ontological implications which we have been exploring above — are lost when it is placed against ‘virtual words’ as an object of study. While no one is suggesting that these terms are mutually exclusive, VR is stepped over, dismissed as a potential trait of some virtual worlds but often, in the case of single-player games, is a term for describing experiences that are less ‘real’. The gesture of VR is simulation and not sociality. The latter not only defines virtual worlds but earns them that status of ‘alternative realities’ (Boellstorff <a href="#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>:395). The somewhat oxymoronic term ‘virtual reality’, implies the complete opposite of real, something that we know is not real yet feels otherwise to an extent. Boellstorff is not the only scholar who has been preoccupied with the task of validating the reality of ‘virtual worlds’; Malpas (<a href="#Malpas 2009" target="_blank" title="Malpas J (2009) ‘On the Non-Autonomy of the Virtual’">2009</a>) has argued that they are embedded extensions of everyday reality; at her weekly pizza parties, Turkle (<a href="#Turkle 2011" target="_blank" title="Turkle S (2011) Alone together: why we expect more from technology and less from each other">2011</a>:xi) saw ‘the erosion of boundaries between the real and virtual’ in the way people experience their online identities; even the very notion of an ‘ethnography for the internet’ (Hine <a href="#Hine 2015" target="_blank" title="Hine C (2015) Ethnography for the internet: embedded, embodied and everyday">2015</a>, Garcia et al. <a href="#Garcia 2009" target="_blank" title="Garcia AC, Standlee AI, Bechkoff J and Cui Y 2009, ‘Ethnographic Approaches to the Internet and Computer-Mediated Communication’">2009</a>) presumes the reality of the context and its presence in the ‘real’ (also see, Miller <a href="#Miller 2016" target="_blank" title="Miller D (2016) Social Media in an english village: or how to keep people at just the right distance">2016</a>:2). VR, however, does not emerge for its own sake.</div>
			
<div>One problem with more direct affirmations of the reality of virtual worlds, like Boellstorff’s (<a href="#Boellstorff 2016" target="_blank" title="Boellstorff (2016) ‘For whom the ontology turns: theorizing the digital real’">2016</a>), is the vagueness attached to the term ‘real’ itself – though if this can be convincingly conveyed, it does elevate the importance and perceived ramifications of a project. The value of VR is closely tied to the fact that it is not real in a particular physical sense but nevertheless feels otherwise. It should go without saying that it is all a matter of context — I did really kill that dragon… in Skyrim VR (Howard <a href="#Howard 2017" target="_blank" title="Howard T (director) (2017) Elder scrolls v: Skyrim VR [videogame]">2017</a>).  The values and beliefs that are tied up in the act of seeking and creating something that fulfils these conditions, that is a simulation which continues to approach something indistinguishable from reality, have not received enough attention. One evidence of this is the lack of anthropological literature I had to engage with in the previous sections. But we need to expand our understanding of what encompasses of the phenomenon; the act itself of defining VR is often an expression of the very conditions we are seeking to engage with. In this way, reviewing how VR is generally defined, as I have done here, does more than locate our point of inquiry.</div>
			
<div>In contrast to definitions of VR that have been explored throughout this essay, an anthropology of VR should not be concerned with the origins of individualism as a historical question. Of course, such understandings are relevant to VR as a topic – what it is, what is motivating its development etc. – as we have explored, but we should not let this distract us from the human phenomenon we are ultimately trying to understand. An effort must be made to accommodate for VR’s own creative responses to these questions. Anthropology is in a unique position to do this, not only because of the methodological traditions it has at its disposal, such as participant observation, but because VR will not be engaged with for its own sake, but for the sake of enabling a new understanding to the human. This focus is what can pull desperate approaches, like the experience of using VR verses the history of ideas it emerged from, together – VR ceases to be an end in itself and becomes a means of understanding the human, something to think about the human with.</div>
		
	<h4 id="3.18.7"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.18.7</a> VR is a Violence</h4>
			
<div>This essay has been concerned with framing VR as an anthropological issue, something anthropologists ought to take seriously and think the anthropological question with. It should be obvious that the core method of anthropological engagements, namely ethnography, is entirely absent from my investigation. The only real reason a can give for this is a lack of sufficient space to do that topic justice and address such a complex issue. But I do have space to say that I have at least, I believe, addressed things in the correct order. We must come to terms with VR first, and its potential framing as an anthropological question before describing the method by which we might explore it. If we pose the question correctly enough, the way forward for further research should become obvious anyway. All I will say here is that traditional ethnographies hardly give VR space to move as what it is, and that if anything, we should treat VR as a kind of anthropology in and of itself. But here I am going beyond the intended scope of the present essay, which was to frame and prove VR as an anthropological problem.</div>
			
<div>If anthropology is defined by that which it seeks to understand, namely the human, rather than some methodological tradition like ethnographic fieldwork – and a very specific understanding at what ethnography entails – there  might be no more pressing issue to the discipline than the current technological innovations seeking to redefine the human and 'its contracts with reality'. Such innovations are being ignored, however, due to their incompatibility with traditional ethnographic ‘fieldwork’. This essay has been an attempt at describing one of those ambitions that is redefining human experience, taking it incredibly seriously as an anthropological problem.</div>

3.19</a> From the NPC's Point of View (a)</h3>

<div>About halfway through The Last of Us Part II, players’ perspectives suddenly shift, time rewinds, and we must re-enact history from the enemy’s point of view. Analysing the game as an artwork and literary piece, there has already been much discussion surrounding the legitimacy and function of this shift in perspective. Many have described this controversial decision in game design as an attempt from developers to elicit empathy in the player, forcing them to reflect on the justification of their violent actions (Harrold <a href="#Harrold 2020" target="_blank" title="Harrold K (2 August 2020) ‘The Last of Us Part II: Why Abby Deserves Your Empathy’">2020</a>; Sdiri <a href="#Sdiri 2020" target="_blank" title="Sdiri E (2 July 2020) ‘The Last of Us Part II is an Imperfect Lesson on Empathy’">2020</a>; van der Linden <a href="#van der Linden 2020" target="_blank" title="van der Linden T (2020) ‘The painful art of empathy — deconstructing The Last of Us: Part II’ [video]">2020</a>). It can be difficult to play as a character you just spent ten hours trying to murder in a revenge plot, which is exactly what Naughty Dog (Druckmann et al. <a href="#Druckmann 2020" target="_blank" title="Druckmann N, Newman A and Margenau K (directors) (2020) The last of us part ii [videogame]">2020</a>) asks players to do. Any player who does not experience more than a mere shift in perspective – that is, a complicating of their intentions in the game world and a sympathising with the other playable character, Abby – signals a failure on the developer’s part: ‘but I just didn’t find any of those characters or events remotely interesting’ (Skill Up <a href="#Skill up 2020" target="_blank" title="Skill Up (12 June 2020) ‘The Last of Us Part II - review’ [video]">2020</a>:<a href="https://youtu.be/GB20A8CitRU?t=1359" target="_blank" title="watch">22’39”</a>). The developers have failed to produce an object of entertainment which elicits the emotional response critics and players have interpreted them to be trying to achieve.</div>

	<h3 id="3.20"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.20</a> The Videogame is Radically Unresolved (b)</h3>

<div>But this is not what a videogame is. The violent images on the screen are not a series of cultural artefacts to be analysed. If we start from the phenomenon, that is playing the game, it does not direct us to regard it as an object. Of course, we can make this true of any media. Any interpretation is also a participation of sorts, and a negative appraisal of a film or painting might well be attributed to a failure on the consumer’s or critic’s part. But in those cases, there is a collective acceptance, invited by the experience of the thing itself, that it is an object in question and that it already exists. And though everyone sees things differently, we can at least agree that we are all talking about the same thing. But none of this is true with videogames. We cannot rely on Bogost’s (<a href="#Bogost 2015" target="_blank" title="Bogost I (2015) How to talk about videogames">2015</a>:ix) likening videogames to toasters, which occludes to much of the phenomenon from the outset. The game does not exist until someone plays it, the player constitutes an essential part in the game’s becoming and no two instances of the game, no two playthroughs, are the same. The context of every violent image is different for every person who plays the <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. The fact that the game has been scripted and planned out by Naughty Dog does nothing to change this because a videogame, before anything else, before it can be regarding as a thing, is something that you do. All other game elements are subordinate to the player as agent.</div>
		
<div>This includes the story. Cut scenes derive meaning from the context of gameplay and are even designed, written, performed and animated as a response to gameplay. In a recent interview, Evan Hill (<a href="#Hill 2020" target="_blank" title="Hill E (2020) ‘How a Last of Us Part II level is made’ [video]">2020</a>:<a href="https://youtu.be/KW4JlxAEAE0?t=115" target="_blank" title="watch">1’55”</a>) explained his process designing a level in The Last of Us Part II called ‘The Birthday Gift’. Hill talks about playing through a basic ‘block mesh’ with full character animations and sprites from the very beginning of the level’s two-year development. Visual elements, dialogue and even entire scenes which play a significant role in the game’s narrative emerged as products of this experimentation through play. Aspects of the characters we know as Ellie and Abby were iterated on through the process of playing as that character. Even before the game was playable, very early outlines of the game’s story were built on the parameters and opportunities of the medium as something that is performed. From the beginning these were characters to be played and it was a story to be actioned and not just observed. In this way, The Last of Us Part II is something you become along with and, in an important sense, you are Ellie and Abby producing these images of violence.</div>
	
	<h3 id="3.21"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.21</a> Videogames do not have Characters</h3>
		
<div>Phenomena we would typically describe as characters, under normal conventions for analysing film or literature, are strained under that classification in videogames – at least if we want to keep what the game is in focus. In many respects, Ellie and Abby are not just two characters you play as for ten hours each, they are performances, things you become or applications for your sense of self. So, for our purposes here, it is not enough to say that you empathise for a character by assuming them as a role and doing their actions for them in the game. Even if we consider the game’s narrative in isolation, the characters interpreted are in response to gameplay as the presupposition. Ellie and Abby, as characters presented during cutscenes and dialogue, are an answer to your act of playing. They are Naughty Dog’s reply to your decision to play – and to continue to play – their game. Of course, that reply can contain within it all the elements we might identify in a film but leaning on this association would be a mistake. The meaning of any particular cutscene is framed by the actions you took to trigger it. The meaning and significance of the experience is fundamentally dependent on your participation in this dialogical act that is playing the game.</div>

	<h3 id="3.22"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.22</a> Agency</h3>
		
<div>But none of this means players necessarily have any real control over the ultimate effects of their actions. While it is true that violent images are often not required and it is possible to sneak passed enemies in the tall grass, there are other times when Naughty Dog forces the player’s hand, and progress is made conditional on the production of these images, regardless of how conflicted we feel about it. Ellie, as a character, feels like her life is out of control, like she is bound to this violent path, even when a very different and happy life is made available to her she cannot accept it. Availability of choices is not the issue here. Her sense of self has become tied up in a quest for vengeance, not only as a means of coping with grief, but as a means of understanding the purpose of her existence. She has no other mode of being, this is what living and surviving in the world of The Last of Us Part II entails; and this is how we play the game. Ellies the character is a description of that becoming. She is its manifestation. Like Ellie, players do not really have a non-violent option.</div>
		
<div>And it seems that Naughty Dog wants us to come to terms with the violent image by participating in it, by revealing the violence within ourselves – the violence we are capable of actioning not only for the sake of revenge, but love, and for that which makes us fundamentally human. It is the characters in the game who cannot come to terms with their participation in the evil of the world, those who believe they can truly solve the problem of violence for good, who commit and are capable of the greatest and most inhuman atrocities for the sake of that vision. It can easily be argued that Ellie, the player, too, has taken up such a path, but this is something that can only be revealed fully from without, not while we are playing as Ellie. Hence the importance of Abby as a performance or alternative way of inhabiting the game’s world.</div>
		
<div>However, these elements of the experience do nothing to stifle the infinite plane that is the production of violent images through the creative act of gameplay. Agency has nothing to do with quantities of choice, which is like adding infinities together, but rather, dialogue. For, a videogame is a type of dialogue. Here I am using dialogue to evoke Buber (<a href="#Buber 1923" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1923/1987) I and thou">1923/1958</a>) and his way of understanding a particular relationality we can enter into with a person or object that cannot be reduced to either party. Our sense of self is conditional and constituted by these kinds of dialogical events, as was shown above with Levinas (<a href="#Levinas 1969" target="_blank" title="Levinas E (1969) Totality and infinity">1969</a>). The self is not protected and isolated from the interactions we have with other people or things and neither is the it isolated from the actions that are taken in the course of playing a videogame. A videogame frames the self within a particular dialogical situation and shapes it as much as anything else does. We obviously are not passive observers and a videogame is always infinitely more than an object we can analyse or critique. A videogame is what happens between devices and people, including game developers, and nothing that is essential to the experience can be located solely in any one party. As dialogue, a videogame is a dynamic event impossible to predict. No two people’s experiences are the same. Though players can only express themselves in the exact way developers have made possible, there is still an essentially unquantifiable and irreducible component – a part that is infinite, transpiring between the player, developers and game.</div>
	
	<h3 id="3.23"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.23</a> Violence in Dialogue (b)</h3>
		
<div>In the dialogical event we are considering here, Naughty Dog’s role is to facilitate the player’s participation in images of violence, and this enables a certain becoming. Playing The Last of Us Part II, one feels incredibly capable – like most action-RPG videogames. Even if certain sequences are difficult or frightening, overcoming those only feeds that sense of empowerment. And there are really two instances of this, two becomings being generated, because to play Abby feels fundamentally different to Ellie. Abby is more athletic and capable in some ways and this makes her feel dangerous. I felt dangerous and scared for myself, as Ellie, and anticipated having to try and kill her and wondered who I would be when the time came for these two ways of playing the game to coalesce. Each character signals a self-affirmation, a feeling of control, but the collision of these makes no sense according to the typical means by which this or any videogame is experienced.</div>

<div>This contradiction in The Last of Us Part II is a dialogic response to that feeling of empowerment. Playing the game, you become efficient at producing violent images that progresses you through the story. So, Naughty Dog enables the framing of two conflicting senses of self and makes game progress conditional on the pursuit of violence towards the self as other. When you are Abby trying to kill Ellie as an NPC (non-player character) that NPC is the impossible representation of your actual self. This is in a way that is more profound than looking in a mirror because the event is dialogic, and it no longer represents the performance you are in the habit of experiencing. So, there is a distance, but the confounding association persists that is irreconcilable. There is a temptation to retreat, to disengage from the game into the sense of self that is stable, informed by the objects and people around you that is the precondition for playing the game in the first place.  This is how Naughty Dog can reveal the players’ actions and desires to the player, by letting them participate in the violent image they wanted but in a way that makes them feel out of control. Players do not get to choose who they are when the violent image unfolds, and it is often hard for us to comprehend what we are doing.</div>

3.24</a> From the NPC's Point of View (b)</h3>
		
<div>This othering of the self is something that can only be understood from without because within the flow of playing the game it makes no sense at all: How can I kill Ellie when she represents my becoming in the game-world? Granted, the impermanence of death in games can be seen as the express denial of the death of the self, you can always respawn and try again. But the presence of Abby, as a different way of being in the same game-world is something of a counterweight to the ambition of this typical death mechanic in games. When I am Abby, it is hard to believe there is anything I cannot kill. But can I kill myself as the other? That feels like a real and strange possibility when playing Abby. Thus, playing Abby does more than reveal Abby to us as a person we can empathise with, it reveals Ellie as the other.</div>

<div>We realise that the becoming that was the unity of our sense of self in the context of the game, was never ours to begin with and this is disorientating. This is how the othering of the self puts one’s own volition into question. It is like being shown that you were wrong, not just about some objective fact, but about yourself. You have overestimated your ability to comprehend the otherness you behold and the other does not just overflow your grasp, but you yourself do as well. By playing as Abby, Naughty Dog and players convey the most radical othering of the self imaginable not because Abby epitomizes extreme difference in relation to Ellie or the player, but because she is the closest.</div>
		
<div>At the beginning of the game, after Abby kills Joel (who we play in the previous game) Ellie’s motivations for revenge, the player’s motivations, are henceforth framed by that event. Abby contextualises the event we enter into, as Ellie, and what we become. Every image of violence, every game mechanic and sequence are in pursuit of this revenge narrative or a violent image that will reconcile and fulfil Ellie as something that is performed.  Of course, some players may not be invested in the story – they might only be playing the game for the gameplay – but remember that the narrative presented is a response to that gameplay. Playing the game already presupposes an intentional generation of violent images. Ellie is a violent character because we are violent players and The Last of Us Part II is a violent game. During the first half of the game while playing as Ellie, Abby represents the impetus and motivation for our generation of the violent image. She is the closest horizon, the perimeter of what can be totalized as a self while playing the game. Playing Abby is the act of performing that horizon, it is the performance of the nearest other in a way that threatens the self.</div>
		
<div>For, the nearest other is always more threatening to the totality of the self than the far off other. Radical difference is always easier to deal with if it can be kept where it is, if we can maintain its alterity because that alterity is what the current self depends on. Granted, we have been saying that to maintain one’s selfhood in the midst of external difference is the essence of identity. But to do the opposite, to allow the self to be affected by the other, to sacrifice the current security and unity afforded by the self as a totality, is exactly what anthropology is. This is something made available in The Last of Us Part II, through the performance of Abby and through our disorientating participation in the production of a violent image depicting violence against our sense of self.</div>

3.25</a> Interlude: Violence is a Stillness (a)</h3>
		
<div>Lara kneels over a puddle rubbing mud onto her body, up her arms and over her face (see Chayer <a href="#Chayer 2018" target="_blank" title="Chayer D (2018) Shadow of the tomb raider [videogame]">2018</a>). Her bow is automatically drawn, and I move forward stealthily with her low, crouching posture. She presses herself against a muddy wall covered in roots and disappears. Everything is still. A man holding a machine gun approaches from around the corner and I am prompted to press the ‘Y’ button. Lara burst out of the foliage slamming her pickaxe into the man’s chest then pulls his body out of sight. This smallest of movements, the clicking impress of the ‘Y’ button – anyone watching me would say I had not moved – has killed him.</div>
		
<div>The violence is given as a lack of resistance. The controller is the shape of my hand and is easy to hold, the buttons are easy to press, and the trigger is easy to pull. There is a fluidity and gracefulness to her movements, a momentum as I jump, climb, fall, roll, dodge, stab and shoot. She wants to keep going and I only must let her, continue what has already happened and do as instructed. Where is thought? There is a calmness to the inner waters of my psyche and each death is absorbed into the still ocean of my being.</div>
		
<div>The first kill felt like a disturbance, but it was also a halting, a sudden resistance to change, an affirmation of internal sameness. Lara is spotted, enemies shout and fire their machine guns at me. She jumps up a ledge and, reaching the top, I see a man climbing up a ladder on the opposite side of the platform. She draws her pistol. I shoot him twice in the head and he falls backward to the ground. I run across a bridge connecting two platforms as Lara reloads. Another enemy approaches on the ground below and I put three bullets in him. In the act of killing lies a hidden word, easily missed though it is screamed, which is satisfying and self-affirming: ‘Me!’. I confirm myself in relation to the other by killing them: ‘Still here!’. I am brooding over the waters of my selfhood and they are still. The other has been consumed but the waters are not disturbed.</div>

<div>This silent word says ‘no’, as in, ‘not otherwise’ – ‘”I” is always a Nay become audible’ (Rosenzweig <a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:173): ‘I am here, I will remain unchanged, and not otherwise’. This self is not dividual, it is not divisible or a constituent of something larger, nor does it enter into relation with other beings for it does not derive its selfhood from any act or event.  It is, rather, an essence that consumes all, the absolute which cannot change, and, therefore, a stillness at all costs. I wake up, chained to a stone altar (see Stratton and Martin <a href="#Stratton 2016" target="_blank" title="Stratton M and Martin H (directors) (2016) Doom [videogame]">2016</a>). A demon stumbles towards me from across the room. Exerting my strength, I break the shackle around my right arm and grab the demon’s face. It explodes as I smash it against the side of the altar, covering the surface in blood. I am the self, undisturbed, I am death, and the language I speak is violence. The objects coming to meet me encounter a vast consuming ocean and when they are swallowed there is not even a ripple.</div>
		
<div>The other is already dead, for the Absolute envelops all things. The objects I see that orbit the special object that is my body are finite entities which are already dying. That is what it means to be an other, ‘For only Others can die; man dies only as an Other, as He’ (Rosenzweig <a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:273). I cannot die, I simply respawn and try again, while the death of my enemies is tied to the progress of the world in which they exist. The death my actions cause is only the fruition of a death that is already fundamental to the objects surrounding my body as others. The deaths these others experience, their plunging into the naught, is unfathomable to me. I cannot comprehend it beyond the maintaining of the self – expressed as ‘Me!’ – that is as wide as eternity and when things die, regardless of their proximity to the special object that is my body, they are absorbed into the stillness of the naught that is me.</div>
		
<div>I cannot die now, but when I die it will be the ultimate affirmation of self and this is how violence directed towards my self is to be understood, a movement towards the infinite stillness. B=B is the equation Rosenzweig (<a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:69) assigns to human selfhood and no human state expresses this notion more fully and truly than that of the corpse. The violence I experience is indeed a halting of my agency by an outside force, but it is also a gesture that reduces the virtual lines or potentialities connected to my body, a foreshadowing of their eventual coalesce when all becomes still. Such stillness is the self’s source. This death occurs eschatologically, at the end of the game when all sixteen colossi have been slain and no others remain to be consumed and the silent words are spoken, ‘it is finished’ (see Ueda <a href="#Ueda 2005" target="_blank" title="Ueda F (director) (2005) Shadow of the colossus [videogame]">2005</a>).</div>
		
<div>The unconditional surrender of German forces was signed on May 7, 1945, ending the Second World War in Europe (Parker <a href="#Parker 2001" target="_blank" title="Parker RAC (2001) The Second World War: a short history">2001</a>:223), but I am still shooting Nazis. Inside a large ship, I am sitting in a wheelchair (see Matthies <a href="#Matthies 2017" target="_blank" title="Matthies J (director) (2017), Wolfenstein II: the new colossus [videogame]">2017</a>). Guns are firing on the other side of the bulkhead opposite me. I roll towards a wounded comrade resting in the threshold that separates me from the action. He says, ‘Take this. They’re looking for you’, and hands me a ‘machinepistol’. I don’t hesitate to awkwardly roll through the door in my wheelchair and casually gun down the Nazi at the end of the hall.  Somehow the war is still happening, and the command of some field officer at the beach on D-Day to ‘Fire on the enemy!’ is crystallised and endures through history and technology and I find myself hearing and obeying. I am not shooting a man, I am shooting some remnant of an ideology that has culminated in the form of a man, a collection of pixels displayed on my monitor as a picture I can manipulate to convey the death of an idea that people believed in and died for. However, for that reason, this is real violence and I am shooting a man. He died eighty years ago, and I shot him today.</div>

3.26</a> The Anthropological Question</h3>

<div>The anthropological question, which anthropology broadly addresses, goes like this: What is the human being? It has become more common to describe anthropology’s scope and mission with an emphasis on humanity’s diversity; for Ingold (<a href="#Ingold 2014" target="_blank" title="Ingold T (2014) ‘That’s enough about ethnography!’">2014</a>:388), ‘to do anthropology’ is to study ‘the conditions and possibilities of being human’ and Strathern (<a href="#Strathern 2005" target="_blank" title="Strathern M (2005) ‘Prologue’">2005</a>:xii) has located the ‘genius of anthropology’ in its ‘descriptive engagement with the act of description, with how people generate accounts of themselves’. These definitions of anthropology reflect styles of thought that have emerged in response to the anthropological question – What is the human? – and this is because there are complex ethical implications for anyone willing to take it up. Anthropology is like no other science. To contribute towards a description of what the human is, in a way that is anthropological, entails regarding the humans around us in a particular way – in a way that makes everything relevant to the question. Our relationships with people behove us to iterate on how we ask it, their gaze reflecting our own demands this much from us. But the question itself has stayed the same since Kant (<a href="#Kant 1798" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1798/2006) Anthropology from a pragmatic point of view">1765/1992</a>:538) first asked it in his lectures, and is as violent today as it was then.</div>
		
<div>All anthropological research holds this question as its presupposition. This includes when ‘What is the human being?’ has not been expressly stated and the research has other explicit objectives, like the description of political violence, racism or drought and famine (Wutich and Brewis <a href="#Wutich 2014" target="_blank" title="Wutich A and Brewis A (2014) ‘Food, water, and scarcity: toward a broader anthropology of resource insecurity’">2014</a>). Not only are these still relevant to this question of inexhaustible scope – the human being as a condition of asking questions has got to do with everything – but they contribute to its essential totalising gesture. The act of research assumes some ground can be gained regarding what the human is. This is even true of those reflexive researchers who go to the trouble of problematizing the anthropological question itself.</div>
		
<div>For example, Lévi-Strauss’ (<a href="#Lévi–Strauss 1963" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1963) Structural anthropology">1963</a>) structural anthropology exemplifies the creative thinking that must take place when the anthropological question is confronted for its own sake. How can there be a specific object when ‘our researches transform their objects’ (Lévi-Strauss <a href="#Lévi–Strauss 1963" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1963) Structural anthropology">1963</a>:19)? For, Lévi-Strauss understood that the anthropological question does not ask for a description of any specific object, but a description of what is conditional on there being any object whatever. The best we can do is show how the object in question is expressing itself: What is the structure of the human being as a performance? What are the elements of this structure? This is why Lévi-Strauss (<a href="#Lévi–Strauss 1971" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1971) The scope of anthropology">1971</a>:16) associated social anthropology with semiology – ‘its object of study the life of signs at the heart of social life’ – and did not evoke social anthropology’s foundation in the anthropological question explicitly. To ask, ‘What is the human?’ and expect a straightforward description is too much. There is no ‘atom of kinship’ to be described,</div>
<blockquote class="small">…we do not need to explain how the maternal uncle emerged in the kinship structure: He does not emerge — he is present initially. Indeed, the presence of the maternal uncle is a necessary precondition for the structure to exist. (Lévi-Strauss <a href="#Lévi–Strauss 1963" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1963) Structural anthropology">1963</a>:46)</blockquote>
<div>In this way, Levi-Strauss’ structural anthropology hinges on a Kantian critique,  which puts constraints on the question itself. We must only ask for an incomplete picture, a description of the relationship between humanity’s elements, rather than purporting to uncover the nature of the elements themselves. Thus, Lévi-Strauss demonstrates an acute awareness of the problematic nature of the anthropological question. And none of this awareness is distracting from the anthropological project but is the source of Lévi-Strauss’ most valuable contributions to the discipline and beyond, namely structuralism.</div>
		
<div>Nevertheless, the process of doing anthropology, then, is still an inexhaustible one and this scope is an inherent feature of all anthropological research. Lévi-Strauss’ (<a href="#Lévi–Strauss 1971" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1971) The scope of anthropology">1971</a>) construal of the anthropological question — or any act of interpreting the question, creating a mission for anthropology, isolating what it means to do anthropology — does nothing to limit the object of inquiry. Conversely, it embraces its vastness, follows through, enacting an ambition equal to Kant’s (<a href="#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>). Kantian inspired reflexivity towards the conditions of engagement, like structuralism, does give anthropology an object in the conditions themselves, a ‘wide and stormy ocean, the true home of illusion’ (Kant <a href="#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>:A236), so vast that it consumes the researcher. And this reflects the totalising nature of the question. The act of limiting presupposes an object of inexhaustible scope, takes the question seriously, and thus participates in the question’s totalising gesture. The human will always be the most expansive object to study because it is the means by which there are any objects at all. This is what Kant (<a href="#Kant 1798" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1798/2006) Anthropology from a pragmatic point of view">1765/1992</a>:538) meant when he made all philosophical questions subordinate to the anthropological one.</div>
	
	<h3 id="3.27"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.27</a> A Violent Discipline Without Scope</h3>
		
<div>From here the obvious critique of anthropology is that is too broad, its subject too big. I’ve herd anthropologists boast for their discipline at conferences, saying that while other human sciences might study humanity’s individual parts, (physiology studies the body, psychology studies the brain, etc.) only anthropology studies the whole human – ‘To argue for holism is to state the obvious in anthropology’ (Parkin <a href="#Parkin 2011" target="_blank" title="Parkin D (2011) ‘Introduction: emergence and convergence’">2011</a>:1). These assertions are declaring ‘What is the human?’, with all its scope and ambition, as a premise of the enterprise. The idea is not ambitious in a way that designates everything imaginable to anthropology, even without the impetus of the question. No one has been doing anthropology unbeknownst to them. It is that anything can be viewed and incorporated into anthropological discussion when viewed in the right way; anything can be made relevant. And I would take things further still, beyond mere relevance. Any object, in itself, can serve as the entire means of access into an understanding of the human. It only takes a researcher to make the question of the human explicit in that particular object. And how can this not be the case? We have got to do with everything we experience, we are humans, and anything can tell us something about what the human is, ad infinitum, if we can find the right way to think with it.</div>
		
<div>But we have to grasp what we have determined as our point of access in a particular way, we have to frame it in relation to the question and this is a violent thing to do. Anthropology is not only violent because the discipline has historically been the handmaiden of colonialist expansion. The anthropological question entails an engagement with the an other – that is, an instance of the human or expression of humanity that is different (at least for the anthropologist) – in a way that is more fundamental than historical narratives describe, even when these descriptions detail how we came to ask the anthropological question in the first place. It is not a gesture the discipline can ever grow out of because we will always need something to think with, an other. This is even true for Buber’s philosophical anthropology where the other could be my best friend who I have known my whole life. Regardless of proximity, the inquiry is not for the other person or thing’s own sake but for the sake of the question. Because the question is what frames the engagement, the questioning anthropologist has made an inevitable reduction. This experience is an object for my intellectual pursuits, and I want to harness its difference to serve my own question, to broaden my picture of what the human is or can be. Herein lies the hostility of the question: ‘What is the human?’, as a pervading potential contextualisation for all our engagements with the world. Perhaps this is why Ingold (<a href="#Ingold 2014" target="_blank" title="Ingold T (2014) ‘That’s enough about ethnography!’">2014</a>:386) paints ethnography as a type of engagement which occurs after the fact and in retrospect. Buber (<a href="#Buber 1965" target="_blank" title="Buber M (1965) The knowledge of man">1965</a>:73-74) also talks about the importance of not having the question in mind during the event in question, not assuming an objective stance. But in these examples, the gesture remains essentially unchanged whether it occurs during fieldwork or afterwards. And, as we saw with Lévi-Strauss (<a href="#Lévi–Strauss 1971" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1971) The scope of anthropology">1971</a>), problematising the question itself doesn’t help here either because limiting or reframing it acknowledges the totalizing nature of its object. To pick up the question, to do anthropology, frames the other as a problem to be solved and, in this way, is a violent thing to do.</div>

	<h3 id="3.28"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.28</a> The Anthropological Image (b)</h3>
		
<div>All this means that the anthropological image of the human is a violent image. Of course, there is no single image of the human we can attribute to anthropology, here I am generalising out of necessity. The image in question is never singular and it is always changing and to properly show how and why anthropology’s image of the human is in its current orientation would require a long historical narrative – something like what Charles Taylor (<a href="#Taylor 1989" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (1989) Sources of the self">1989</a>; <a href="#Taylor 2007" target="_blank" title="Taylor C (2007) A Secular Age">2007</a>) has done for the modern sense of self and secular modernity. Such a detour would take us too far from the intentions of this project. All we need to go on with, is an idea of the general gesture, as it stands of what anthropology has been up to lately and why that image has not escaped the violence described in the previous section.</div>
		
<div>Now, of course some of the most recent developments in the discipline have been an effort overcome this violence through an anti-colonialism. We see this in Viveiros de Castro’s (<a href="#Viveiros de Castro 2014" target="_blank" title="Viveiros de Castro E (2014) Cannibal Metaphysics">2014</a>:40) definition when he defines anthropology or describes its new task as the decolonisation of thought. The problematic he uses to introduce this idea in <em>Cannibal Metaphysics</em> is exactly Kantian. He is asking where anthropology’s ideas come from, the colonialist stance being to attribute them to the anthropologist herself or the discourse emerging within the discipline, the decolonising stance would be to attribute anthropological insight back to the people anthropologists study, to give it back to them, and elevate them as potential anthropologists.  Viveiros de Castro wants to address a similar problem to Kant (<a href="#Kant 1781" target="_blank" title="Kant I (1781/2007) Critique of pure reason">1781/2007</a>), How are a priori synthetic judgements possible?, or in other words, where do the concepts we employ to understand what we encounter in the world come from? We know Viveiros de Castro’s intentions match this Kantian ambition, otherwise he would not talk about decolonising thought, he would be more specific about his reference to the discipline of anthropology. Thought has historically been a process that, if it did not follow colonialist gestures as explicitly as anthropology has, it has at least been the benefactor of imperialism and the political apparatuses connected to it. The institutions of thought, those in the business of generating thought, the university, academia, presuppose a logic of extraction and accumulation which decolonisation entails the dismantling of. The irony of what Viveiros de Castro is suggesting is that the human science, what was once the spearhead of the colonising logic of thought, enacting the dehumanisation inherent in the extraction and accumulation of the human as object of thought, anthropology, will now be the source of a kind of redemption, where things come full circle. And the broadness of this vision entails a radical stance on the Kantian problematic. Where Kant laboured for a comprise between Newton and Leibnitz – a mutual involvement of the a priori and a posteriori in the generation of experience, transcendental idealism, where a priori rules that are the preconditions of experience (idealism) allow us to confront discoverable otherness (science, objectivity etc.), thereby unifying philosophy and science – anthropology cannot abide such an in-between stance. The reason for this is that the otherness anthropology has come to encounter, leads to a questioning of the validity of science. And the motivation presupposed in the entering into the problematic of the source of knowledge, unlike Kant, is normative and aware of a narrative nearing the end of its Karmic cycle. So here anthropology will simply pick a side in a way that will defuse the problematic entirely, anthropology will opt for perspectivism, a radical tolerance that gives everything over to the Other as the rightful owner of the originalities anthropology has historically taken credit for discovering. Kant’s transcendental idealism obviously did not resolve the problem in a satisfactory way for a great many thinkers and I have no interest in pursuing the validity of what Kant proposed here, but because Kant was looking to confront the tension between the two stances itself, he enabled a new space of the discussion to proceed. There is a violence to Kant’s first critique that stands separate from his racism, anthropocentrism, patriarchal and other flawed logics, which lies in his confrontation of the problem itself, head on, allowing it to stay a problem. While stepping away from the former violences anthropology has also abandoned the latter.</div>

<div>This is the anthropological image of the human we will be working with here. The anthropological question is a violent thing to do, to enter into a situation with other humans while the human itself is the problematic framing the encounter and the image generated by that discourse is the most fundamentally violent image. The violence of descriptions of violence or of a violent photograph is laide bare, it is how we frame our understanding of the situation but the anthropological image is violent in a more fundamental sense. It is not violent because violence is contained within the image, it is violent because it is an image. The imagness of the phenomeon is the violence.</div>
	
	<h3 id="3.29"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.29</a> Exploring Death in the Outer Wilds</h3>
		
<div>Outer Wilds (Beachum <a href="#Beachum 2019" target="_blank" title="Beachum A (director) (2019) Outer wilds [videogame]">2019</a>), like many other indie games, is an exception to this and is particularly relevant to the present discussion because of the ways it is able to explore death and offer its own kind of redemption that is unique to gaming. In it, you explore a solar system of planets in your spaceship, discovering the remains and translating the texts of an ancient alien race. Through this process, you piece together how this civilisation came to your solar system and their extinction. After twenty-two minutes of exploring, the sun in your solar system goes supernova killing you and everything else with it. After this, the player is sent back in time to the beginning of the game to start over again. There is no form of combat in the game or enemies to fight, the only gameplay loop is to somehow solve the puzzle of the narrative. That is, find out why the sun is going supernova, how you keep getting sent back in time, and if there is a way to stop it and save yourself.</div>
		
<div>Despite the lack of violence, death is continually present and depicted in a number of ways. Player death is frequent, even besides the supernova that sends you back to the start of the game every twenty-two minutes. Because the game has no enemies, you always die due to some accident, peculiarity in the environment or naturally occurring phenomena. This often makes death feel somewhat meaningless, the result of chance in an indifferent universe. There is never any intentionality behind your death, no enemy to kill you, only your own mistakes and pure entropy. For example, you might forget to put your spacesuit on before exiting your spaceship or an island launched out of the atmosphere by a giant twister could collide with your spaceship. Player death is not the result of any conflict besides a very grand existential kind of conflict between you and the universe. While the play, die, repeat death mechanic is still very present here, that mechanic is being employed to express something about our fundamental situation as human beings. There is no avenging your death on a second playthrough, it just happened because death is part of living in this world.</div>
		
<div>This is the context in which you read texts from an ancient civilisation, who you find is also grappling with their place in an indifferent universe, seeking redemption therein. You learn of the tragic circumstances that left them stranded in this solar system, their failed attempts to discover the deepest secrets of the universe and how that curiosity and quest for redemption ironically led to their extinction. You read dialogues of them coming to terms with the finite nature of the universe:</div>
<blockquote class="small">This universe will keep getting colder and larger, until one day, the stars and the life they support will die. That’s scary to think about, even though Conoy tells me it won’t happen in our lifetimes. But it’ll happen in someone else’s, someday!</blockquote>
<div>It is a game about how life, even on a cosmic scale, is fundamentally finite and chaotic.</div>
		
<div>But that is only half of the experience the game offers, as this focus on death enables it to provide a kind of redemption that is both poignant and unique to videogames. Further, it is not the kind of redemption I referred to earlier that we find in many other videogames, notwithstanding the number of representations of death, that lean out of lived human experience. Outer Wilds offers a redemption that is not unlike what we see in The Brothers Karamazov (Dostoevsky <a href="#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>) and it provides such in a way that is only possible through interactive media.</div>
		
<div>The aesthetics of the game plays a role here because Outer Wilds offers the player an opportunity to participate in depictions of creation in a way that points back to creation itself (once again, I am using ‘creation’ in the Rosenzweigian sense here). The game’s graphics are not aiming specifically at realism, but they are beautiful representations of things we see regularly, like the stars in the night sky. The ability to get in your spaceship, fly towards them, see the planets in motion, each eclipsing the sun in its turn seems to create a small version of ‘the overview effect’ described by astronauts who have looked down on the earth from space. Seeing the earth from such a vantage point elicits an emotional response and often a dramatic paradigm shift; one beholds ‘spaceship earth’. Death is everywhere in a universe that feels indifferent to human suffering, but the constant miracle of creation is ever present and affirming. Because this takes place within an interactive medium, the fact that you are activity discovering this beauty yourself makes this experience particularly affecting in a way that bleeds out into your everyday life. In this way, the game changes the way you think about and move within your everyday life and encourages you to embrace that which is redemptive in the game, namely exploration and discovery.</div>

3.30</a> Redemption</h3>
		
<div>An epiphany that is available in Outer Wilds — for it can only be made available — is not unlike Alyosha’s in <em>The Brother’s Karamazov</em>. Rather than trying to make everything in the universe add up in a particular way, Alyosha accepts his participation in what is wrong with the world, he takes on something of that responsibility and this opens his eyes to the constant miracle before him:</div>
<blockquote class="small">Filled with rapture, his soul yearned for freedom, space, vastness. Over him the heavenly dome, full of quiet, shining stars, hung boundlessly. From the zenith to the horizon the still-dim Milky Way stretched its double strand. Night, fresh and quiet, almost unstirring, enveloped the earth. White towers and golden domes of the church gleamed in the sapphire sky. The luxuriant autumn flowers in the flowerbeds near the house had fallen asleep until morning. The silence of the earth seemed to merge with the silence of the heavens, the mystery of the earth touched the mystery of the stars… Alyosha stood gazing and suddenly, as if he had been cut down, threw himself to the earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="small">He did not know why he was embracing it, he did not try to understand why he longed so irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss all of it, but he was kissing it, weeping, sobbing, and watering it with his tears, and he vowed ecstatically to love it, to love it unto ages of ages. ‘Water the earth with the tears of your joy, and love those tears…’, rang in his soul. What was he weeping for? Oh, in his rapture he wept even for the stars that shone on him from the abyss, and ‘he  was not ashamed of his ecstasy’. It was as if threads from all those innumerable worlds of God all came together in his soul, and it was trembling all over, ‘touching other worlds’. He wanted to forgive everyone and for everything, and to ask forgiveness, oh not for himself! But for all and for everything, ‘as others are asking for me’, rang again in his soul. But with each moment he felt clearly and almost tangibly something as firm and immovable as this heavenly vault descend into his soul. Some sort of idea, as it were, was coming to reign in his mind — now for the whole of his life and unto ages of ages. He fell to the earth a weak youth and rose up a fighter, steadfast for the rest of his life, and he knew it and felt it suddenly, in that very moment of his ecstasy. Never, never in all his life would Alyosha forget that moment. ‘Someone visited my soul in that hour’, he would say afterwards, with firm belief in his words…</blockquote>
<blockquote class="small">Three days later he left the monastery, which was also in accordance with the words of the late elder, who had bidden him to ‘sojourn in the world’. (Dostoevsky <a href="#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>:362-363)</blockquote>
<div>Of course, while Alyosha did not question his desire to kiss and love creation with all his heart, from that moment in the story the character does actively question and participate in the role he interprets to be his calling, that is to ‘sojourn in the world’. Not to transcend it or intellectually solve it somehow, but to participate in it, accepting his participating in the evil and actively trying to be that which is redeeming in the world, not seeking personal redemption but that of the worlds. This is the kind of thing you do as the player in <em>Outer Wilds</em>. In this way, it is not a game that holds your hand, it will never tell you what to do next. You, as the player, as the recipient of death and entropy in this world of chaos makes a choice to be a part of it, through the recognition of its value and beauty notwithstanding death. Doing so entails, like Alyosha, your own ‘sojourn in the world’ as you attempt to be part of the solution, leaning into your own participation and finding redemption in the same. That redemption comes through the process of learning more about the world by being in it, thus knowledge or learning is another one of the games major themes. Redemption comes via a particular type of learning, namely experiencing, and this is something videogames have the potential to address in ways that other mediums have not been able to. This redemptive experience, however, does not come from acting in a hyper-realistic rendition of the world we already know, it comes through game mechanics that highlight particularly human themes, saying something about what it means to be human, what it means to participate in the world, leaning into the human condition. I know of no other game that does this as effectively as <em>Outer Wilds</em>, but that does not mean it is alone — nothing about the game design is unprecedented, we have only been slow to recognise what videogames have to say about the anthropological question; ‘what is the human being?’.</div>

3.31</a> Violence in Dialogue (c)</h3>
		
<div>On top of Deleuze (<a href="#Deleuze 1983" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G (1983/2013), Cinema 1: the movement image">1983/2013</a>) observation about things concealing their essence in their genesis, this has been due to what videogames are generally understood to be. Many people like to defend the artistic merit of the medium, advocating for an acknowledgement of creative expression on the level of films or literature. Of course, that the individual constituents of a game like the story, music or art is not disputed. The concern is whether a videogame as a whole should be culturally recognised and valued in the same way a classic film is. But in many ways, compared to these other ‘artistic’ mediums, a videogame is not a single experience, because everyone who plays the game will have a fundamentally different one. In this way, a game should not be regarded as a single work but as a dialogue that takes place between the player and the game designers. The game is designed with the player in mind, attempting to create a particular experience within a set of parameters. The player then responds to and acts within the system that is being presented to them. There is a degree to which the game designers have no control over what the player will choose to do and thus how the experience will be interpreted. Sometimes games are frustrating when the designer and player have misunderstood each other. Sometimes we find a way to play the game the designers did not anticipate, like, for example in speedruns. Videogames are a fundamentally interactive media and when you play a game you are participating in a kind of dialogue that has been anticipated by the game designers.</div>
		
<div>	As a kind of dialogue, games can be redeeming in ways that lean in or out of human experience. For example, a game world has the potential to saturate the player in a world of pure intentionality. By that, I mean that everything that happens in the three-dimensional world is deliberate and placed there for a reason. If I go outside my house and find a rock on the ground, no one put that rock there for me, it fell or rolled there somehow but the fact that its there has nothing to do with me — leaving aside the potential philosophical complications we could introduce here with idealism for now. In a game, however — and this is particularly evident in VR experiences — everything has been put there for me but some game designer. That is validating to me, I am the centre of that world. This might be one reason why videogames have been slow to provide redemptive experiences that lean into the human condition. There is already something inherently redemptive and validating about moving in a three-dimensional virtual space which is moving in the opposite direction. This makes experiences like what we see in Outer Wilds all the more remarkable, however, because the experience of intentionality is all still there. The game has obviously been designed around the player, and unlike some games with randomly generated worlds, it does not try to hide the fact that every aspect of the world has been meticulously placed in such a way so as to create a puzzle for you to solve. Not trying to hide it, is actually what allows the game to overcome the inherent aspects of the medium that lean out of lived experience. In this way, it embraces the fact that is is a dialogue and the redemptive experience of the game depends on this dialogic element. I was constantly curious to see what the writers and game designers would have to say about the universe as I uncovered the steps needed in order to reach the end of the game. The pursuit of a perfect simulation and perfect graphical realism can be associated with a similar ambition to hide the authorship of a videogame, as making such obvious would inevitably break the immersion. But redemption through immersion, or we could also call it escapism, is not only artistically boring; it says nothing about the human condition. If people want videogames to be taken more seriously, they should not be regarded as a work of art but as a conversation that takes place. A videogame is an invitation to take part in a dialogue, granted it is a profoundly limited and usually one-way dialogue, but a dialogue none the less. It is via this attribute that videogames are contributing and will continue to contribute to our understanding of the human and how being a human in the world is reconciled by many individuals.</div>

3.32</a> The Sacred 'And'</h3>

<div>Real violence, beyond the production of a violent image, is, of course an unresolved dialogic event. So, there is an advantage to the representations of violence in videogames which is less present in photography or film, which resides in the unresolved nature of the image.</div>
		
<div>There is a fundamental violence to the gesture of videogames, which resembles anthropology’s gesture towards an other, namely the violence of representation. But the suffering other demands something from us; their gaze seems to demand a recognition of their otherness notwithstanding our only recourse for doing so often being the reduction of their suffering into something that can be represented. For, it is frequently outside our power to immediately alleviate their suffering. A flawed representation is how we can take their suffering seriously, keep it open and make space for excess. Though this entails the generation of an image – the only means we have of representing otherness is inherently reductive – we have means of keeping the image open and allowing space within our representations for an ‘and’. The And is sacred and can never be resolved.</div>
		
<div>Anthropology has achieved this in the past through a great deal of reflexivity. Researchers bracket their studies to only tackle a portion of the human phenomenon in question, only claiming to point towards the experience of the other, recounting a dialogic situation and never claiming to capture the other in its totality. This is all evoked as a kind of compensation or apology for our insufficient means of presenting some human phenomenon to the world. And we have already mentioned above how great cinema can make the same apology through its various creative techniques, so that the captured image constitutes only a part of the experience of a film: editing, dialogue and themes, all have the potential to transcend the image.</div>
	
	<h3 id="3.33"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
3.33</a> A Creative Apology</h3>
		
<div>Unlike cinema or ethnography, in which the genius of the artform lies in overcoming the capturing and reductive gesture of the camera or method, videogames are open by default. We play a role in the generation of the violent image explicitly, but the image is always unresolved. There is no claim to totalisation, except for what videogames borrow from other media, because the image being generated always holds some potentiality, some secret, something incomprehensible that can only be revealed through its relation to the next image. And this next image can never be anticipated, even by the game developers, at least during gameplay. Even when a cutscene happens, what follows it is open and unresolved. A film can be an object that is static, it has completed its becoming and all it needs is a viewer. Of course, there are many possible interpretations of a film and in that sense, it is dynamic, but not so next to a videogame. A videogame is an event and violent images in videogames, though they can be just as reductive as any violent image when considered as an object, are acts of imaging. They are a process of the player orientating themselves in relation to the phenomenon of violence in the abstract sense.</div>
		
<div>This orientation can be limited because the event of a videogames is never entirely the players’. The gaze of the suffering other means that each party contributing to the event has an obligation to preserve and show reverence towards the And. I say ‘preserve’ because it is present in the fundamental gesture of videogames, as actions. Inasmuch as videogames have adopted techniques of capture from other mediums, they must also perform a creative apology. That is, the means of capture and representation needs to be problematized. But, of course, this is going to be taking place in a radically different way than other mediums, because those participating in the event that is videogames do not have the option of regarding the videogame as an object to be critiqued or made more complicated through historical positioning, and it cannot be placed next to other instances in the genre, in order to generate a kind of dialog between the cases. Many do this anyway, even perhaps while playing the game, but the moment they do, what is unique to videogames, what makes this phenomenon such a valuable contribution to our understanding of the human being, is no longer being referred to. Even in this essay, I have been analysing <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> as if it were a thing, but nothing about what I am doing here conveys even a part of what it is like to play the game. In videogames, the And must be preserved along the way by both players and developers. Developers must make the way available, but the complexity of violence can never be truly acknowledged by them alone. On the other hand, players can only go so far in the intentionality behind their actions to preserve something irreducible, to resist playing the game as an act of self-affirmation that kills any sense of otherness. In most videogames I have played, there is little space made for the jeopardising of our sense of self. Yet, in the beginning, in the days of Zork (Anderson et al. <a href="#Anderson 1977" target="_blank" title="Anderson T, Blank M, Lebling D and Daniels B (1977) Zork [videogame]">1977</a>), this is all videogames were; again, this is the essential gesture of the medium.</div>
		
<div>There are an infinite number of ways to play any videogame and The <em>Last of Us Part II</em> is no exception. Beyond the particularities associated with how a player uses their hands to manipulate the image on the screen, how they push the buttons on the controller, this also encompasses everything players give to the videogame as an event, as a dialogic situation unfolding that they are only a part of. Many who played <em>Part II</em> have interpreted their experience as an orientation towards a nihilistic stance in relation to the world, or that the game’s message is hopelessness (see Tolbert <a href="#Tolbert 2020" target="_blank" title="Tolbert S (3 July 2020) ‘The Last of Part 2’s ending is a broken tale of nihilistic indulgence’">2020</a>; Myers <a href="#Myers 2020" target="_blank" title="Myers M (12 June 2020) ‘The Last of Us Part 2 review: We’re better than this’">2020</a>). This is what they understand Naughty Dog to be trying to do to them and is a reflection of the style by which the game was played. That is to say, Naughty Dog is not the sole author of the experience and these interpretations of the game, as a text, reflect those players contributions to the game’s becoming, perhaps more than anything else. Of course, the interpretation of a text always reveals something of the person doing the interpretation. So, what does this say about <em>Part II</em> as a videogame, beyond the fact that videogames have the potential to throw this feature of art criticism into relief?  Only that imaging violence is a shared responsibility, which neither those who are representing or those who encounter the representation can fully live up to on their own. For, in videogames it becomes obvious that we all participate in the process of representation – we all participate in that violence. But we can leave our images open, thus maintaining the irreducibility of violence, when images are no longer objects, but unresolved performances. This is something videogames, like <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, are teaching us how to do.</div>
		
<div>And the final cut-scene of the game encouraged my own awareness of this, when Ellie  says  to Joel – confronting him as the character who, we might say, represents the responsibility of every violent image produced in the series – to Joel, the personification violence: ‘I don’t think I can ever forgive you for that… but I’m willing to try’. The openness and unresolved nature of this statement is what enables the redemption of Ellie as a character. But she is also an invitation for how to perform the game, for there is always a ‘New Game’ to be selected in the menu, and there is always new meaning to be given to the next violent image we are working to produce.</div>

3.34</a> Interlude: Love is Caprice</h3>
		
<div>Sam bends down and fastens a container of precious smart drugs onto his back (see Kojima <a href="#Kojima 2019" target="_blank" title="Kojima H (director) (2019) Death stranding [videogame]">2019</a>). Rocky green hills stretch out before me and a dotted line overlays the scene indicating to Sam the path he is to traverse. As I begin down the slope in front of him, the heavy load of cargo rocks to one side and for a moment it seems that I am about to tumble down the slope and off the cliff up ahead. With the left trigger, Sam is able to regain his balance and come to a stop before the sheer drop. There is no way forward and backtracking is my only option. But Sam’s situation is suddenly jolted, and a new truth erupts into existence. I see that some stranger’s caprice has deposited a rope to allow for a safe decent. This is the chaos of the new and not the mere execution of preestablished code written in the game’s script. An actual individual, somewhere in the world, for reasons I will never know, saved me from a minor inconvenience. Regardless of that person’s intent, I am grateful to them, and it does not matter that they will never know. We are connected and I have done nothing but let it happen: ‘Let there be light’.</div>
		
<div>A ladder can function as a bridge, allowing Sam to cross a deep chasm and deliver the packages. I do not need to collect the ladder once the crossing is complete and if Sam abandons it, the ladder will remain on the network, likely to be discovered and gratefully used by some random player I will never meet. It is difficult to tell if Sam will need to use the ladder at some future stage in my journey, but such inconveniences seem small compared to the thought of the relief a stranger might experience as a result of what we leave behind. So, for reasons not fully understood to us, we let it stay: ‘Let us make human-kind…’.</div>
		
<div>This caprice is love. It is the same love Rosenzweig (<a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:218) sees in ‘love your neighbour’, for the word ‘neighbour’ describes</div>
<blockquote class="small">the nearest neighbour… the one who is nearest to me, at least at this moment, regardless of what he may have been before or will be afterward. Thus, the neighbour is only a representative.</blockquote>
<div>It could and must be anyone, and there is a chaos to this any-person-whatever. The neighbour has earned nothing, they have stumbled into our path through entropy’s curtain and landed here, before us, and we can do something about them. or, rather, we can let ourselves be open to them and the possibility that is their being. The ladder does not care who finds it, for it has already been deposited. In the same way, love presupposes an other in the specific, nearest sense, but the contents of which is always open, full of potentiality into infinity.</div>
		
<div>This love cannot be selective because it embraces the chaos of uncertainty. The discrimination of selection is only justifiable in relation to the second nearest. This second nearest evokes a version of love that is void of spontaneity and creativity. It is a kind of love which poses no threat to the stability of the isolated self, it is convenient, comfortable and still. A gesture of compassion for the human or group ‘out there’, away from me, or present but too broad to become manifest as an individual which might disturb something inside me. I have chosen this as a cause that I can sympathise with: this is the initial gesture of the second nearest. The nearest, by contrast, commences as an event, an opening up to the universe. We enter into relation with an other and the contents of that other is open and that is the gesture.</div>

<div>This describes what it is to be an anthropologist. It is to recognise the other in the any, to open oneself to that other as the nearest, the emerging human before us which we are experiencing at this moment. The selection of informants has nothing to do with anthropology, it is not necessarily prior to or a condition of thought towards the potentialities of the human. The forces that brought Evans-Pritchard (<a href="#Evans-Pritchard 1937" target="_blank" title="Evans-Pritchard EE (1937/1976) Witchcraft, oracles, and magic among the Azande">1937/1976</a>) to sit in front a Zande, asking why they poisoned a chicken, are incidental. Our confrontation with the other is its own isolated and spontaneous event, it is always new and cannot be planned.  In contrast, pursuit of the other that is far away and most radically different from oneself for its own sake is only to grasp at the second nearest. This second nearest is the least radical place to find an other, it confirms the other as other and poses no threat to the self. Thus, it cannot grasp the emerging human because the second nearest is full of presuppositions and such is the violence that hedges up the self.</div>
		
<div>Love is to give of oneself, to say ‘yes’ as a creative eruption negating the no of the self, to lose one’s life. Where are the ladders and ropes we left for an other? We cannot be sure because we have lost them for the sake of that which ‘always erupts anew. It is a matter of always starting over from the beginning’ (Rosenzweig <a href="#Rosenzweig 1921" target="_blank" title="Rosenzweig F (1921/1985), The Star of redemption">1921/1985</a>:215). Over fifty hours of save data lays dormant in the game world, it describes a self and trajectory which could remain, a stillness which cost nothing and yet everything. A chaos erupts, a window into the aught suddenly becomes manifest in the form of a single question:</div>
<!--to do--><div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/578881107?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="ATB (Active Time Battle) in FFVII Remake"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
<div>The world is created again through deletion of the self. The past no longer presses down on the present, for past is past, the present is rebirth and the caprice of love rolls forth. The save file that was laboured for is the weight of the past.</div>
		
<div>This is not a rejection of the past. We need the past as something to give and surrender. Our past was full of love and we keep memories of love which teach us to love today,</div>
<blockquote class="small">…for no memories are more precious to a man than those of his earliest childhood in his parental home, and that is almost always so, as long as there is even a little bit of love and unity in the family. But from a very bad family, too, one can keep precious memories, if only one’s soul knows how to seek out what is precious. (Dostoevsky <a href="#Dostoevsky 1880" target="_blank" title="Dostoevsky F (1880/2004) The brothers Karamazov">1880/2004</a>:290)</blockquote>
<div>But for love to exist in the here and now, between us and the other who finds us today, we must act what is unprecedented in the mutual generation of the new – that is what the past should teach us. In other words, we must be disturbed. The history of anthropology is filled with insight stained with the violence of colonialism, but we know those stains are not anthropology. The past was a spontaneous event of love – someone left a rope for us – and as such is the source of our salvation. But refusing to leave a ladder bridge behind because we want to preserve the landscape, clinging to a tradition, that is the stillness of violence.</div>
		
<div>Fidelity is caprice, fraternity is tumult and marriage is the entropy of intentionality. Bergson (<a href="#Bergson 1907" target="_blank" title="Bergson (1907/2007) Creative Evolution">1907/2007</a>:143-144) distinguishes two kinds of disorder, one that is a lack of intentionality and another which violates utility. Here, we are evoking the second kind, that is, the randomness of creative acts. In that sense, marriage or any kind of human institution entailing a commitment is disorder as a mutual and creative evolution. All human commitments require continuous and spontaneous change from every member, towards their nearest. For, to separate is to stay the same, preserving the self as it is, but together we are changed and the love between us will be recreated, as if for the first time, with every new instant. This is what Gabriel Marcel (<a href="#Marcel 1964" target="_blank" title="Marcel G (1964/2002) Creative fidelity">1964/2002</a>) meant by ‘creative fidelity’, where the commitment of love becomes faith – the love that belief entails – belief in God, the world, people, the other or anything whatever. This is a seeking to be changed rather than a conquest to apprehend, seize or extract knowledge from. The latter is how we lose our purview of the human condition and that is how we lose anthropology.</div>

3.35</a> Our Sacred 'And', the Next Game I Play, etc.</h3>
		
<div>There is a game I have not played yet and it is always be the next game I will play. The game will show me the human being as it is, it is something I will do, and it will be an anthropology equal to the ambition of Hegel’s (<a href="#Hegel 1807" target="_blank" title="Hegel GWF (1807/1977) Phenomenology of spirit">1807/1977</a>) Absolute Knowing. But it is always the next one and for that reason, it is showing me how I am violent and is teaching me how to love. I don’t know what it looks like or how to play it and a fear sometimes rises inside me that things will go no further. But every time I look at my son that fear receives a reply: ‘not yet’.</div>

4.1</a> The Videogame Event as Simple</h3>
		
<div>We are reaching the limits of the term ‘real’ here, so I will perform a conceptual shift: when I say the act of playing a videogame is more real than any recording or description, I mean it is more simple. By this I mean, in an important sense, that the event in question is irreducible, ineffable and intellectually indomitable. This way of considering the event of playing videogames is in relation to, and opposed to, the complex involvements and baggage of images. I say the image is complex but the event itself is simple. This way of thinking, this allocation of the term simplicity, is detailed in Craig Dilworth’s (2013) book titled, Simplicity: A Meta-Metaphysics. There, over a hundred examples of simplicity are provided but the first three Dilworth (2013:14) describes are the self (‘understood in this way… [w]e cannot form a concept of the self’ but we take it to exist), the present (the present ‘exists in time without occupying time’) and cause itself (we understand specific examples of cause ‘but we cannot form a clear concept of cause itself’ – Hume’s ‘crux metaphysicorum’ [Kant 1783/2004:63] which, for Kant [1783/2004:10], ‘interrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave a completely different direction to my researches in the field of speculative philosophy’). When something is regarded as simple, further abstractions or accidents will make no contribution to our understanding of the concept, principle or category. Kant’s (1781/2007) noumena, Wittgenstein’s (1921/2014:89) ‘what we cannot speak about’ and Gabriel Marcel’s (1964/2002:55-56) meta-problematic, are thought of as simple in their respective philosophical systems or styles. Simplicity serves as a mysterious and apparently necessary limiting case: ‘I say that I think something is completely simple, only because I have really nothing to say of it than merely that it is something’ (Kant cited in Dilworth 2013:15). Simplicity is not an ontic or ontological claim but, somewhat like Laruelle’s (1996/2017) non-philosophy, is a way of thinking about and comparing different ways of thinking. It can be a framework for the democratizing process of generating and identifying new perspectives. (In a way, this is also what anthropology is, especially for people like Descola [2005/2013], Holbraad [2017], Kohn [2013], Viveiros de Castro, etc.).</div>
		
<div>In certain cases, like the videogame event we are concerned with here, we can describe something as simple because it is a transcendental principle of our thinking – transcendental in the Kantian sense, which pertains to the fundamental conditions of experience (Kant 1781/2007:A11-A12), but also more broadly, not necessarily in a philosophical context (Dilworth 2013:53). Here, in this study of the human, the videogame, as an event, is a condition of engagement in the same way writing or reading are conditions. In this sense it is transcendental. This project cannot problematise the existence of the videogame event because that event must be presupposed for the specific thinking we are engaged in as reader/writer; I am using the videogame to think, thinking with videogames and hopefully so can my reader. Thus, attributes like true/false or real/unreal cannot be applied to it in a straightforward way. I am not referring to the image, or the videogame as an object to be developed, distributed, sold, etc. I am referring to the actual human event, the unfolding and unpredictable dialogue that emerges whenever a videogame is played. Entering into that event is how I generated the following ideas. It is what I used to think. It is therefore transcendental or in other words, more broadly, it is simple. At lease, this is one way to think of the inter-human videogame event as simple.</div>
		
<div>This ‘simplicity way of thinking’ (Dilworth 2013:13) is applicable to any instance where fundamentals are being carefully considered. In mathematics we could describe Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem as simple and many anthropological concepts can easily be thought of in this way, like fieldwork, anti-structure (Turner 1967:125), liminality (van Gennep 1960), play (Caillois 1961/2001), deep play (Geertz 1973:432), ‘superrationalism’ (Lévi-Strauss 1955/2011:58) ‘ontology’ (Charbonnier 2017:167) etc. [BME1] This is not to suggest that nothing can be said about these ideas, only that, as estimations towards some element of the human condition, they can be thought of as simple. This is especially true if we compare the ideas and concepts listed above to the broader complex details and data which are employed by anthropologists to point to them.  As an image, this document is complex, like those specific images which have already been presented and described through gameplay footage and prose. This complexity will be leveraged to point towards the human event of a videogame as simple, that being something we cannot reduce into a representation without leaving a great deal, an infinity, of remainder.</div>

	<h3 id="4.2"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
4.2</a> 'The Second Level'</h3>
		
<div>Concerning simplicity, Dilworth makes a further distinction between analytic simplicity and synthetic simplicity. He refers to this division as ‘The Second Level’. While I was researching and writing the early drafts of this document, I did not have simplicity, or this division, in mind; I had not yet encountered Dilworth’s book. But the project can nevertheless be drawn out, its structure can be described, according to analytic and synthetic simplicity. Throughout this work, I seek to point towards and draw attention to elements of the human event of videogames, which cannot be confined to an image, which are simple. We could say this happens in the following order: analytic, synthetic, synthetic, analytic. I will make the difference between analytic and synthetic simplicity apparent through a summery of this document, a description of this image.</div>
		
<div>The level after this one titled ‘The Videogame Event and Its Image’ identifies analytic simplicity in ‘real movement’, that is movement that cannot be quantified or reduced à la Bergson, in response to Deleuze’s identification of the same in cinema. This real movement is analytically simple because I take the broad phenomenon, that is our experience with the image, and locate therein some element which is irreducible and infinite, namely dialogue. The event of movement in videogames becomes an ‘unanalysable element’ (Dilworth 2013:24). Everything surrounding this fundamental element I regard to be complex. I describe that complexity in a way that directs us towards a central event, an in-betweenness, i.e. the result of players collaborating with developers to generate a spontaneous image. Via a brief interlude, I then explore the image itself, as a wholistic event, at first phenomenologically, to regard it as synthetically simple. I say it is synthetically simple, because the phenomenon of the image here is stretched out, broadened to encompass how the human experiences the image as an event. The event of the image in videogames becomes a ‘synthetic totality’ (Dilworth 2013:24). So, the level contains two perspectives, two ways of pointing towards the human event, as simple, around the phenomenon of a videogame. This is done by describing the image as complex in two different ways, pointing to the human event as both internally (analytically) and externally (synthetically) simple via a vis the image.</div>
		
<div>The final level titled, ‘Anthropology and the Violent Image’ begins with a construal of the image as synthetically simple. That is, as a broad reductive culmination of the infinite complexity of a violent event. Violence is ultimately described as a stillness here which is participated in or entered into by the player. A conceptual shift to analytic simplicity is then made through reflecting on my own participation in the production of violent images in videogames. An agency and spontaneity is then located within the event of the image. This unpredictability and caprice within the event of the image itself is drawn on to access a reading of redemption which is then applied not only to videogames but anthropology too. We have returned to analytic simplicity but this time in a way that is almost ethically motivated, while in the first level this began as a purely theoretical investigation attempting to apply some of Deleuze’s ideas to videogames.</div>
		
<div>So, the project here is to employ perspectives to frame the human in relation to the videogame, more than notwithstanding and in spite of the image, but via the image, which is all we have to work with. We can say this is accomplished by construing the image as complex in different ways to reveal how the human event we are concerned with is simple in different ways.</div>
	
	<h3 id="4.3"><a href="#C" title="Contents">
4.3</a> The Videogame via Difference and Repetition</h3>
		
<div>As has already been stated, I did not have Dilworth’s work in mind for the majority of the writing and research process. Simplicity is something that helped me at a later stage conceptualise the project for myself and I have attempted to convey that clarity to my reader at this early stage where it will advantage them the most. But this is not the only way to think about and structure the anthropological image that follows. One of the early impetuses for this project came from Deleuze’s work, particularly his cinema books. It was simply a curiosity, to see how Deleuze’s concepts about the cinema could be applied to more recent media like videogames and specifically virtual reality. This is why the next level opens with a comparison between cinema and videogames. And more than this starting point, the entire project can be framed around</div>
		
<div>The videogame event is first considered as Difference because I separate it out of the experience and it manifests itself as a source of violence, a spontaneous eruption which takes place in a dialogic event of a videogame. Then via a brief interlude the videogame event is conceived of as Repetition and the maintenance of a continues, impossible to enclose experience.</div>
		
<div>Then the violent image is experiences as repetition again, as an invalid encapsulation of something irreducible, violence is a stillness, which causes us to retreat into Difference again to articulate and salvage a kind of redemption.</div>
