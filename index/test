<h3>0-1 How to Read This Document</h3> 
		
<div>I call this document an image. It is an image on my monitor, as I write and manipulated it through software. It is an image for my reader — the image on your screen.</div> 
<br>		
<div>This image is the by-product of a dialogue between myself and the developers of the various software I used to produce it, namely <em>Microsoft Word</em> <span class="reference">(Microsoft <a href="r.html#Microsoft 1983" target="_blank" title="Microsoft (developer) Microsoft word [software]">1983</a>)</span>, <em>Scrivener</em> <span class="reference">(Blout <a href="r.html#Blout 2007" target="_blank" title="Blout K (original author) (2007) Scrivener [software]">2007</a>)</span>, <em>EMACS</em> <span class="reference">(Moon and Steele <a href="r.html#Moon 1976" target="_blank" title="Moon DA and Steele Jr. GL (original authors) (1976) Emacs">1976</a>)</span>, <em>Adobe Dreamweaver</em> <span class="reference">(Adobe <a href="r.html#Adobe 1997" target="_blank" title="Adobe (1997) Adobe dreamweaver [software]">1997</a>)</span>, <em>Obsidian</em> <span class="reference">(Li and  Xu <a href="r.html#Li 2020" target="_blank" title="Li S and Xu E (original authors) (2020) Obsidian [software]">2020</a>)</span> and finally <em>Notepad++</em> <span class="reference">(Ho <a href="r.html#Ho 2003" target="_blank" title="Ho D (developer) (2003) Notepad++ [software]">2003</a>)</span>. I do not mean that I spoke with the developers of these computer programs in person or on <em>Zoom</em> <span class="reference">(Yuan <a href="r.html#Yuan 2011" target="_blank" title="Yuan (original author) (2011) Zoom [software]">2011</a>)</span>. The software itself is a dialogic event, which now involves my reader; it has always been this.</div>   
<br>		
<div>It was even dialogic when I tried to write without using any software at all, which is how I wrote the first drafts of the sections about <em>Street Fighter</em> <span class="reference">(Funamizu et al. <a href="r.html#Funamizu 1995" target="_blank" title="Funamizu N, Murata H and Itsuno H (designers) (1995) Street fighter alpha 3 [videogame]">1995</a>; Nakayama <a href="r.html#Nakayama 2016" target="_blank" title="Nakayama T (director) (2016) Street fighter V [videogame]">2016</a>; Nishiyama <a href="r.html#Nishiyama 1987" target="_blank" title="Nishiyama T (director) (1987) Street fighter [videogame]">1987</a>; Okamoto <a href="r.html#Okamoto 1991" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y (director) (1991) Street fighter II [videogame]">1991</a>; Okamoto et al. <a href="r.html#Okamoto 1999" target="_blank" title="Okamoto Y, Funamizu N and Nakajima (producers) (1999) Street fighter III: 3rd strike [videogame]">1999</a>; Tsukamoto <a href="r.html#Tsukamoto 2008" target="_blank" title="Tsukamoto T (director) (2008) Street fighter IV [videogame]">2008</a>)</span>. I wrote them in 2019 with a <em>Palomino Blackwing 602</em> <span class="reference">(California Cedar Products Company c. <a href="r.html#California 2019" target="_blank" title="California Cedar Products Company (c. 2019) Palomino Blackwing 602 [pencil]">2019</a>)</span> on loose-leaf paper in the Deakin University, Burwood Campus, Library Scholars’ Room. I scanned those pages using the library's scanner which sent them to my email. The original manuscript has since been lost but here is a sample of that early draft:</div>

<div>Because this essay is about digital images, and because it was produced as a digital image (the above instance about <em>Street Fighter</em> is not an exception to this because those efforts towards a non-digital procedure were designed to aide my understanding of my participation in this final digital image; it was a gesture towards, and all for the sake of, this digital image) it ought to be read as a digital image. And though I appreciate any time my reader gives to the production of a new instance of this image — I am grateful to be a part of any new image — I do have a preference. This preference stems from more than an author's pedantic desire for consistency through topic and reader experience. The image I seek to fulfil here, with my reader, cannot transpire and cannot be experienced on a printed page. It can only be read and viewed and participated in, in the fullest sense, with a swiping thumb suspended over a smartphone or with a hand resting on a mouse. For, this image is interactive, as I will now partially explain.</div>
<br>
<div>Though textbooks familiar to us and Geertz <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Geertz 1973" target="_blank" title="Geertz C (1973) The interpretation of cultures: selected essays">1973</a>:6)</span> say ‘doing ethnography is establishing rapport, selecting informants, transcribing texts, taking genealogies, mapping fields, keeping a diary, and so on’ — and though we often find ourselves, with Lévi–Strauss <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Lévi–Strauss 1962" target="_blank" title="Lévi–Strauss C (1962/2021) Wild thought: a new translation of la pensée sauvage">1955/2011</a>:17)</span>, ‘proposing to tell the story of my expeditions’ — there is a consensus among anthropologists to follow Geertz's <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Geertz 1973" target="_blank" title="Geertz C (1973) The interpretation of cultures: selected essays">1973</a>:6)</span> clarification vis-à-vis the ethnographic method, at least to the point of ‘these things, techniques and received procedures’ being insufficient for a definition of anthropology. More recently, beyond an ‘elaborate venture in . . . "thick description"’ <span class="reference">(Geertz <a href="r.html#Geertz 1973" target="_blank" title="Geertz C (1973) The interpretation of cultures: selected essays">1973</a>:6)</span> we have further supplementals to the method, rounding out and complicating anthropology's understanding of itself: ‘Anthropology . . .  is <em>philosophy with the people in</em>’ <span class="reference">(Ingold <a href="r.html#Ingold Febrary 2014" target="_blank" title="Ingold T (February 2014) 'Anthropology and philosophy or the problem of ontological symmetry’">2014</a>:para.1)</span>; ‘Anthropology [can be] . . . the theory/practice of the permanent decolonization of thought’ <span class="reference">(Viveiros de Castro <a href="r.html#Viveiros de Castro 2014" target="_blank" title="Viveiros de Castro E (2014) Cannibal metaphysics">2014</a>:40)</span>; ‘Anthropology is a venture in cultural transformation’ <span class="reference">(Pandian <a href="r.html#Pandian 2019" target="_blank" title="Pandian A (2019) A possible anthropology: methods for uneasy times">2019</a>:6)</span>, etc. But none of this negates the practice of ethnography. When Pandian <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Pandian 2019" target="_blank" title="Pandian A (2019) A possible anthropology: methods for uneasy times">2019</a>:8)</span> frames anthropology as a means of ‘sustaining contrary ways of imagining and inhabiting the contemporary world’, he associates these features of the anthropological project with its methodological heritage and resists ‘disavowing this heritage altogether’. Ethnographic images of the master of the fishing spear's live burial <span class="reference">(Lienhardt <a href="r.html#Lienhardt 1961" target="_blank" title="Lienhardt G (1961) Divinity and experience: the religion of the Dinka">1961</a>:300)</span>, an Azande consultation with a poison oracle <span class="reference">(Evans-Pritchard <a href="r.html#Evans-Pritchard 1937" target="_blank" title="Evans-Pritchard EE (1937/1976) Witchcraft, oracles, and magic among the Azande">1937/1976</a>:127)</span>, a Ndembu circumcision rite <span class="reference">(Turner <a href="r.html#Turner 1967" target="_blank" title="Turner V (1967/1982) The forest of symbols: aspects of Ndembu Ritual">1967/1982</a>:151)</span>, etc., represent a by-product of the anthropological process still being generated today via/as images of Yukaghir hunting practices <span class="reference">(Willerslev <a href="r.html#Willerslev 2007" target="_blank" title="Willerslev R (2007) Soul hunters: hunting, animism, and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs">2007</a>)</span>, the process of exoplanet astronomy and place-making <span class="reference">(Messeri <a href="r.html#Messeri 2016" target="_blank" title="Messeri L (2016) Placing outer space: an earthly ethnography of other worlds">2016</a>)</span>, ‘expanding ethnography to reach beyond the human’ <span class="reference">(Kohn <a href="r.html#Kohn 2013" target="_blank" title="Kohn E (2013) How forests think: toward an anthropology beyond the human">2013</a>:6)</span>, etc. This is how contemporary anthropology still finds itself valuing the ethnographic image and despite new definitions still regards itself as what I call an image generating technology.</div> 
<br>
<div>The anthropologist interested in videogames has a different relationship to the phenomena which are to be represented, described and thought with because the human event in question is already a multi-layered image.</div>
<br>
<div id="p1" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/703135105?h=4e3d364027&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" id="f2" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Timeline 1"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script><figcaption class="small"><a href="f.html#p1" target="_blank" title="Staten J, Crocker P and French T (directors) (2021) Halo infinite [videogame]">Play 1</a>: Master Chief with a plasma canon</figcaption>
</figure> <!-- Play 1: Halo Infinite--> 
<br>
<div>It not only conveys the exact arrangement of pixels constituting the human image-event in question (albeit at a lower refresh rate) but delivers a representation of each of my decisions on 22 April 2022 and the culmination of the many prior decisions of the development team which contributed to that singular outcome. Here I am comparing the videogame's capacity to generate human images to anthropology, or more specifically ethnographic practice. In defence of the latter, we could say that the videogame image leaves no room for ‘thick description’ <span class="reference">(Geertz <a href="r.html#Geertz 1973" target="_blank" title="Geertz C (1973) The interpretation of cultures: selected essays">1973</a>:6)</span> because of the inherent coalescence of image and event in the medium; the event itself <em>is</em> an image leaving no thickness to describe, we already have all the data. Therefore, this competing practice of distorted representations of the human ought to be ignored criticised or separated from more compelling human assemblages like online virtual worlds, which can transpire in instances of online gaming but which ought to be separated from the videogame image itself.</div>
<br>
<div>Contrarily, what follows is primarily concerned with the videogame image as a human event, its production and consumption, its inherent violence and creativity. This entails a different understanding of the videogame image than what I presented in the previous paragraph, which in turn opens up a different understanding of the anthropological image. Herein lies the real opportunity for anthropology (and videogames) in this forcing of the discipline to confront and do something with such an unnatural topic. Not only does the videogame image usher anthropological discourse towards new modes; beyond capturing more detail of the human experience we are pressed, in a style Deleuze and Guattari <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Deleuze 1991" target="_blank" title="Deleuze G and Guattari F (1991/2015) What is philosophy?">1991/2015</a>)</span> would welcome, to work <em>with</em> the phenomena to generate new concepts; not only does it contribute to Viveiros de Castro's <span class="reference">(<a href="r.html#Viveiros de Castro 2014" target="_blank" title="Viveiros de Castro E (2014) Cannibal metaphysics">2014</a>:40)</span> ‘decolonization of thought’ but a ‘democracy of thought’ <span class="reference">(Laruelle <a href="r.html#Laruelle 1996" target="_blank" title="Laruelle F (1996/2013) Principles of non-philosophy">1996/2013</a>:69)</span> because the anthropological ethnographic image and the data it rests on to qualify itself have no authority over the videogame image and both images are made equal participants in this new image. The videogame image, and as a consequence the anthropological image with it, are not instances of the human to be described but invitations to enter new human events, new images, of which this project is one. Another more simple but less implicative way to say this is, because the videogame image is already an image and because that image implies features unique to software (it is easily accessible and infinitely reproducible <span class="reference">(see <a href="Free-Software-and-GNU-Linux.html">Free Software and GNU/Linux</a>)</span>) we are spurred to think in new ways, to find a way to contribute something more than the recording. That is, not necessarily to <em>thicken</em> the image, to anthropologise it and make it fulfil the needs of the anthropological discipline's project, but to find new ways <em>into</em> the human image itself as something we perform, to reframe it as a new human event, to generate a new anthropological image.</div>
<br>
<div>Many of the pages that follow, like the present one, contain images and short videos, captured from the videogames being discussed. They should be played and/or viewed in the instances where they occur in the text. These perfect (in one sense) portrayals of the events in question and the images and concepts conveyed in the text are suspended together in a way that is dialogic. This allows for something more to be present in the image and prose together, through a kind of relationality, which would otherwise be impossible.</div>
<br>
<div>By playing each of the videos, this reader/user/viewer/player is producing an image that has not happened yet, collaboratively, with me. This is in the same way I produced the videos throughout, collaboratively with the developers of the videogames that are presented. And I have produced <em>this</em> image (as I said at the beginning) collaboratively with the developers of the software I used to write it.</div> 
<br>
<div>Here is a screenshot from the same section as <a href="#f1" title="Early draft">Figure 1</a>, as I see it now in <em>Notepad++</em>:</div>

<br> 
<div>And though my reader experiences a different view and none of us sees the whole, we can yet still regard <em>Videogames for a New Anthropological Image</em> as a single and shared image.</div>
